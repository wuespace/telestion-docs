This repository contains the documentation for the Telestion Project. It is
available at https://wuespace.github.io/telestion-docs.

_Please note that this **does not** contain technical references for all
Telestion modules. For that, please refer to the individual READMEs and other
resources of the individual modules. Instead, this documentation focuses on more
general documentation of the Telestion project._

## Writer's guide

You can find a guide for writers/contributors to the documentation at
`src/pages/writers-guide.mdx`, or, within the built website, at
`/writers-guide`.

Please familiarize yourself with these guidelines _before_ beginning to write
documentation for the project.

## Templates

The `docs/_templates` folder has a few templates for the most common types of
pages you need to write to document the project.

These also include tips and tricks (as comments) as well as valuable snippets
relevant to this specific type of page (e.g., tutorial)

If you feel like any basic templates are lacking, please search through
[this repository's issues](https://github.com/wuespace/telestion-docs/issues)
for a reference to this type of template. If you don't find any reference to it,
please feel free to open an issue for it yourself.
