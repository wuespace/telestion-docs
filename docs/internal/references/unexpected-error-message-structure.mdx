title: Unexpected Error Message Structure
description:
  You should use Unexpected Error Messages whenever you didn't expect a
  developer to hit an error case. While there's only so much you can do, it's
  crucial to be as helpful as possible to frustrate the developer even further.

<!--
Reference
=========

=== When to use this template:
When you're documenting some topic so that users (e.g., ecosystem developers)
can quickly lookup a fact. These articles typically consist of a list, a
definition list, a table, or some other form of "quick-to-lookup" information.

=== When not to use this template:
Do not use a reference article to explain a concept. You should keep additional
information within the reference article to a minimum so that knowledgeable users
can quickly see the facts that are relevant to them. You can link to concepts and
other topics to explain specific concepts, if necessary.

=== Writing tips:
- Write in the present tense
- Use neutral pronouns (they/them instead of he/she and him/her)
- Be respectful to everyone
- Be aware of the potential for cultural misunderstandings
- Keep the amount of additional information to a minimum (focus on the facts)
- If necessary, link to concept topics. Do not explain them in the article
- Use a suitable form of content so that readers can quickly look up the desired
  information (e.g., a table, a list, a diagram, or something else)

<!-- Short description of what information this document provides: -->

Only use this error message if you didn't expect this exception to ever get
thrown (but couldn't exclude the possibility) and thus have no idea what caused
it.

:::note Example

For this example, we'll assume that for whatever reason, a seemingly valid path
(that already passed validation) got rejected later in the code.

## NADAD: Unepxected Error Message components

Unexpected error messages should follow the **NADAD** structure:

### Notify

Developers appreciate directly getting information, even if it's information
that they don't like. Therefore, you should notify them what caused that unexpected error and where
it occurred:

```text
Unexpected error while trying to perform a network request.
```

### Apologize

The fact that you didn't expect for this to happen means that it is you who
messed up. So instead of trying to blame the developer who uses your library,
admit your mistake and apologize:

```text
We're sorry, it looks like we got an unexpected error.
```

### Describe

Give as good of an explanation as you can to give the other developer a general
understanding of what happened. Maybe, this can help them solve the error
themselves.

```text
We had already validated the requested address, but when trying to request the
resource, the address could no longer be parsed.
```

### Action

We've already discussed that it was your mistake. Thus, it's up to you to fix
it.

Provide instructions on what the developer should do so that you can fix the
mistake. In other words: Provide instructions to, with minimal effort, file a
bug:

```text
Please help us fix the mistake by filing an issue at https://github.com/wuespace/telestion-core/issues/new
and include the entire error message (including the details below) and we'll have a look as soon as we can.
Thanks in advance!
```

### Details

Include any details you might need to find the mistake and either fix a bug or
at least provide an actionable error message:

```text
Details
=======
requestAddress: "http://noejow"
telestion-core version: v0.3.0
```
