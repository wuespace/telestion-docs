title: Actionable Error Message Structure
description:
  You should use Actionable Error Messages whenever you expect for an error to
  occur. Learn how to write them well and improve your library's developer
  experience.

<!--
Reference
=========

=== When to use this template:
When you're documenting some topic so that users (e.g., ecosystem developers)
can quickly lookup a fact. These articles typically consist of a list, a
definition list, a table, or some other form of "quick-to-lookup" information.

=== When not to use this template:
Do not use a reference article to explain a concept. You should keep additional
information within the reference article to a minimum so that knowledgeable users
can quickly see the facts that are relevant to them. You can link to concepts and
other topics to explain specific concepts, if necessary.

=== Writing tips:
- Write in the present tense
- Use neutral pronouns (they/them instead of he/she and him/her)
- Be respectful to everyone
- Be aware of the potential for cultural misunderstandings
- Keep the amount of additional information to a minimum (focus on the facts)
- If necessary, link to concept topics. Do not explain them in the article
- Use a suitable form of content so that readers can quickly look up the desired
  information (e.g., a table, a list, a diagram, or something else)

<!-- Short description of what information this document provides: -->

:::tip Warning messages

Warnings and non-aborting errors (i.e., error logs that don't cause runtime
exceptions) are also considered to be error messages in this context.

:::

Use this error message structure whenever you expected for this error to occur
in specific situations and are able to provide suggestions on how to solve the
problem.

:::note Example

For this example, we'll assume that the developer passed an invalid hostname to
your function.

## AWESA: Actionable Error Message components

Actionable Error Messages should follow the **AWESA** (inspired by the Swahili
term "kuweza" = "to be able to") structure:

### Attention

Describe, as quickly as possible, that an error occurred and what type of error
happenned.

```text
Error validating the passed hostname.
```

### Where (Context)

Describe where and when the error took place.

```text
The hostname provided to validateHostnameOrThrow(hostname) is invalid.
```

:::info Skipping this section

If the context is already clear from the error's
stack trace, you can skip this section.

You should, however, only ever skip this section if it is completely and utterly
clear without any knowledge about your library. 

If in doubt, just leave it in!

:::

### Expected (, but got)

Describe the technical details of what would have been required for the
operation to succeed and what you got instead. This, then, gives developers a
clear idea of your expectations and can help explain any misunderstandings in
the documentation.

```text
Expected hostname to match /^[a-z]+$/, but got "hello1".
```

:::info Skipping this section

You can skip this step if you're unable to provide any further details than the
ones you've already provided in the "Attention" section.

For example, if the validation of the hostname was too complex, you don't need
to write "expected hostname to be valid, but got 'abc'" if your "Attention" step
already says "Hostname 'abc' is invalid."

If, however, like here, you can describe more details (e.g., the validation
regular expression), you should always provide these details to enable
developers to more easily debug the error without having to study your source
code.

:::

### So (... we did this)

Inform the developer about what already hapenned / where in the process (if at
all) you aborted the code's execution and how you otherwise handled the error.

- Did you simply skip the item but otherwise continue the execution?
- Did you already insert a "blank" item into a Database that now contains
  invalid data?
- etc.

```text
The error occurred during the initial validation and no further action took place.
```

### Action (to rectify the situation)

Given that you're writing an actionable error message, you already expected for
this error to occur, and thus, have an idea about what the developer needs to do
in order to not run into this error.

So ... be helpful for once and tell them :wink::

```text
Hostnames can only contain lowercase alphabetic characters (a-z).
Make sure that the host name passed to the function is valid.
```
