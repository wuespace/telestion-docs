Concept
=======

=== When to use this template:
Use this template when you need to describe a concept, technology,
or something similar. In other words: whenever you need to write an
article that describes a concept where the concept's name can be the
article's title (e.g., "Vert. x", "Verticle", "Event Bus")

=== When not to use this template:
Do not use these templates for articles that give context on how
to use/approach the topic. Instead, it would be best if you used a guide for that.

Writing a guide and a concept article are not mutually exclusive. Instead,
you should, in most cases, write both, where the concept gives a brief overview
of what it is, and the guide is a longer article explaining best practices on using
it.

E.g.:
Concept: Event Bus
Guide: Interacting with the Event Bus


=== Writing tips:
- Write in the present tense
- Use neutral pronouns (they/them instead of he/she and him/her)
- Be respectful to everyone
- Be aware of the potential for cultural misunderstandings

<!-- Brief Description (1-3 lines) of the concept: -->

Error messages are a part of practically every application or library we
develop. Especially in libraries (like `telestion-core` or `telestion-client`),
good error messages are crucial for a good developer experience.

:::warning

Developers using your libraries **shouldn't have to know** how your library
works to solve problems. It is therefore crucial to handle potential errors of a
library in the library itself and, if necessary, throw (to the developer using
the library) only higher-level exceptions with good error messages.

However well-written an error message might be: A few abstractions down the line
(i.e., a few layers further up the call stack), they don't really make sense
anymore.

Therefore, _**all** library functions must **always** catch **all** possible errors
and provide **their own** error messages that are helpful in **the context of the
immediate caller** of that function to guarantee for a good developer experience!_

## Error messages for expected errors

It might seem strange, but most errors are actually "expected" errors. For
example, when opening a file, we can already anticipate that the user might not
have the rights to read the file and the operation might, therefore, fail.

This, in turn, means that we're able to write "actionable" error messages, i.e.,
messages that already contain potential solutions.

Whenever it is possible to already "know what went wrong", you should write
so-called _Actionable Error Messages_ that already provide potential solutions
within the error message itself.

## Error messages for unexpected errors

Sometimes, you know that an error is theoretically possible, but you can't
imagine any scenario where it would actually occur.

What's important here is to be up-front with it. While it'll still be
frustrating for developers to learn that you don't have a solution for them,
it's even more frustrating to learn that from a 2 hour search for a solution
that doesn't exist.

In these cases, it's important to be honest and give developers a way to easily
report this bug to us. You should also include a quick apology in your error
message since the fact that you hadn't anticipated the scenerio means it's you
who messed up, and it's also up to you to fix it asap.
