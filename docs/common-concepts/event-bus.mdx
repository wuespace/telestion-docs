Concept
=======

=== When to use this template:
Use this template when you need to describe a concept, technology,
or something similar. In other words: whenever you need to write an
article that describes a concept where the concept's name can be the
article's title (e.g., "Vert. x", "Verticle", "Event Bus")

=== When not to use this template:
Do not use these templates for articles that give context on how
to use/approach the topic. Instead, it would be best if you used a guide for that.

Writing a guide and a concept article are not mutually exclusive. Instead,
you should, in most cases, write both, where the concept gives a brief overview
of what it is, and the guide is a longer article explaining best practices on using
it.

E.g.:
Concept: Event Bus
Guide: Interacting with the Event Bus


=== Writing tips:
- Write in the present tense
- Use neutral pronouns (they/them instead of he/she and him/her)
- Be respectful to everyone
- Be aware of the potential for cultural misunderstandings

<!-- Brief Description (1-3 lines) of the concept: -->

The Event Bus is, basically, the nervous system of the Telestion Ecosystem. The
ecosystem uses the Event Bus for the communication between its various
components.

## Video version

You can find a video version of this concept's explanation here:

## Messages

At the core of the Event Bus, there are so-called _Messages_. Messages are data
packets that you can send to a specific channel. Then, all components monitoring
that channel receive you message.

## Channels and Addresses

A _Channel_ is defined by its _Address_ (or _Channel Address_), which is a
string (text) and essentially serves as the channel's name.

/>

The address typically describes the channel's content (e.g., `raw-telemetry`,
`telecommand-out`, etc.).

:::tip Mental model

As a mental model, you can compare the event bus to radio communication, e.g.,
in Air Traffic Control:

| Concept in Radio Communication | Corresponding concept in the Event Bus |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| Radio Transmission             | Message                                |
| Frequency                      | Address                                |

## Data Pipeline

Through the combination of more than one component
([Verticles](/application/concepts/verticle/) on the _Application_ side) sending
each other messages and performing small, atomic tasks, you can create a sort of
data pipeline that's both easier to think about (as individual components only
need to perform smaller tasks) and more adjustable (since you can just plug
components together in different ways):

<Image
	invertible
	src="/static/img/drawio-diagrams/vertx/data-pipeline.drawio.svg"
	center
/>

## Requests

The event bus also allows for so-called _Requests_.

This enables _Request Messages_ which another component can then respond to.
This is most useful when dealing with data that you don't need constantly, but
only on specific occasions:

<Image
	invertible
	src="/static/img/drawio-diagrams/vertx/requests.drawio.svg"
	center
/>

In more technical terms: _Requests_ enable a polling-based system. This works by
providing a dedicated (auto-generated) response address in the requesting
message and then listening for a response on that channel.

:::info Request Handling

In contrast to the system described in the previous sections (publish/subscribe,
meaning every component monitoring a channel gets notified about every message),
requests are point-to-point based. This means that of all handlers registered
for the request's address, only one of them (determined by a round-robin
algorithm) gets used.

## Event Bus Bridge

The _Event Bus Bridge_ enables communication between the
[Application](/common-concepts/application/) and
[Client](/common-concepts/client/) without the need for an extra API.

<Image
	invertible
	src="/static/img/drawio-diagrams/vertx/eventbus-bridge.drawio.svg"
	center
/>

It achieves this by sharing the event bus (or at least the parts of it that you
configure) via a web socket, meaning the Client can interact with the event bus
as if it were a part of the Application itself.

### Setting up the Event Bus Bridge in the Application

Thankfully, the Vert.x framework already provides an implementation of the
Bridge, meaning all you need to do to enable it in your Application is to add
the corresponding Verticle to your configuration:

````json title='conf/config.json'
{
	"name": "Eventbus Tcp Bridge",
	"verticle": "de.wuespace.telestion.services.connection.EventbusTcpBridge",
	"magnitude": 1,
	"config": {
		"host": "0.0.0.0",
		"port": 9870,
		"inboundPermitted": ["request-time"],
		"outboundPermitted": ["parsed-tm"]
	}
}
````

With that configuration, every client connecting to the Bridge on port `9870`
could now send messages to `request-time` (and receive responses to request
messages) and receive any message published to `parsed-tm`.
