Concept
=======

=== When to use this template:
Use this template when you need to describe a concept, technology,
or something similar. In other words: whenever you need to write an
article that describes a concept where the concept's name can be the
article's title (e.g., "Vert. x", "Verticle", "Event Bus")

=== When not to use this template:
Do not use these templates for articles that give context on how
to use/approach the topic. Instead, it would be best if you used a guide for that.

Writing a guide and a concept article are not mutually exclusive. Instead,
you should, in most cases, write both, where the concept gives a brief overview
of what it is, and the guide is a longer article explaining best practices on using
it.

E.g.:
Concept: Event Bus
Guide: Interacting with the Event Bus


=== Writing tips:
- Write in the present tense
- Use neutral pronouns (they/them instead of he/she and him/her)
- Be respectful to everyone
- Be aware of the potential for cultural misunderstandings

<!-- Brief Description (1-3 lines) of the concept: -->

The Client is the User Interface your Ground Station operators interact with.
It's based on web technologies (with React and TypeScript at the core of its
tech stack) and provides a framework for building re-usable widgets that get
displayed in dashboards.

## Dashboards

Dashboards are pre-defined layouts of one or more widgets within a single page
that you can define for specific users. They are the pages that the ground
station operators interact with and are selectable using the selector at the top
of the user interface.

## Widgets

Widgets are reusable components of the UI that can you can place into dashboards
to visualize Telemetry, send Telecommands, and so on.

By right-clicking into a widget and selecting "Configure", users can also
reconfigure widget that supports that to, for example, choose the fields that
get visualized within a graph widget.
