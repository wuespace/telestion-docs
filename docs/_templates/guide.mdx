Guide
=====

=== When to use this template:
Use this template when you want to explain how to work with a specific technology/concept.

=== When not to use this template:
When
- the article provides a quick explanation of a single concept (use a concept instead)
- the article should be a quick way to look things up (use a reference instead)
- the article focuses on how to solve a particular technical problem (use a tutorial instead)

=== Guide or Tutorial
A tutorial provides a quick, technical "step-by-step" tutorial for a
given problem. Thus, a guide describes less the handling of a specific problem
and more the general interaction of the reader with a given concept.

Example with npm articles:
- "npm": (Concept, explaining what npm is)
- "Installing a dependency with npm" (Tutorial, providing a quick tutorial to
  solve a technical problem)
- "Managing dependencies with npm" (Guide, including both technical knowledge, but
  also best practices and more)

=== Writing tips:
- Write in the present tense
- Use neutral pronouns (they/them instead of he/she and him/her)
- Be respectful to everyone
- Be aware of the potential for cultural misunderstandings
- Guides are more comprehensive than many other article types.
  Feel free to add context and best practices.
- Mention common pitfalls and how not to use something (and why)
