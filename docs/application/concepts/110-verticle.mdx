  The building blocks of the Vert.x framework and Telestion Application

Verticles are the "building blocks," so to speak, of the
[Vert.x framework](/application/concepts/vertx/).

## Basic mechanism

Verticles are, essentially, modular blocks of code that fulfill a specific
function.

They get triggered by either something external or another Verticle and can, in
turn, also trigger other Verticles.

Verticles communicate with each other using messages on the so-called
[Event Bus](/application/concepts/event-bus).

You can think about Verticles as processes in a data flow diagram:

<Image
	src="/static/img/drawio-diagrams/vertx/data-pipeline.drawio.svg"
	invertible
/>

Here, processes are Verticles and the data between them are messages on the
[Event Bus](/application/concepts/event-bus).

## Example Code

````java
import de.wuespace.telestion.api.verticle.GenericConfiguration;
import de.wuespace.telestion.api.verticle.TelestionVerticle;

public class MyVerticle extends TelestionVerticle<GenericConfiguration> {
    // Called when Verticle is deployed
    @Override
    public void onStart() {
    }

    // Optional - called when Verticle is undeployed
    @Override
    public void onStop() {
    }
}
````
