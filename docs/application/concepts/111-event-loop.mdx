=== When to use this template:
Use this template when you need to describe a concept, technology,
or something similar. In other words: whenever you need to write an
article that describes a concept where the concept's name can be the
article's title (e.g., "Vert. x", "Verticle", "Event Bus")

=== When not to use this template:
Do not use these templates for articles that give context on how
to use/approach the topic. Instead, it would be best if you used a guide for that.

Writing a guide and a concept article are not mutually exclusive. Instead,
you should, in most cases, write both, where the concept gives a brief overview
of what it is, and the guide is a longer article explaining best practices on using
it.

E.g.:
Concept: Event Bus
Guide: Interacting with the Event Bus


=== Writing tips:
- Write in the present tense
- Use neutral pronouns (they/them instead of he/she and him/her)
- Be respectful to everyone
- Be aware of the potential for cultural misunderstandings

<!-- Brief Description (1-3 lines) of the concept: -->

The event loop is the executing mechanism of a Verticle.

## Java Thread distribution

In Vert.x, every verticle runs in its own thread and waits for incoming events
(_event-driven_).

The Java main thread executes the Vert.x instance which in turn:

- deploys and undeploys verticles
- coordinates the startup and shutdown of all verticles
- provides the APIs so that verticles can talk to each other and with the
  outside world (e.g. the event bus)

A verticle thread:

- _spawns_ once the verticle starts
- _executes_ asynchronous code inside the verticle on incoming events (which can
  trigger other events)
- _dies_ once the verticle stops

## Event Loop inside a Verticle Thread

<Image
	src="/static/img/drawio-diagrams/vertx/verticle-event-loop.drawio.svg"

/>

Since a verticle is only executed by one thread, this thread must handle all
incoming events and their connected event handlers.

Most of the time this isn't a problem, especially if the event handler is
compact and runs fast code. But once the thread grabs an event handler that
contains blocking or heavy-lifting code, new events clog up the event queue,
making the verticle unresponsive.

Therefore, Vert.x and Telestion use asynchronous code structures to move the
blocking part away from the Verticle Thread into another "service" Thread which
handles the resource-intensive task (e.g. the HTTP server in turn spawns another
Thread in the background to efficiently handle incoming connections).
