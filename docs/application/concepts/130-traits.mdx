Concept
=======

=== When to use this template:
Use this template when you need to describe a concept, technology,
or something similar. In other words: whenever you need to write an
article that describes a concept where the concept's name can be the
article's title (e.g., "Vert. x", "Verticle", "Event Bus")

=== When not to use this template:
Do not use these templates for articles that give context on how
to use/approach the topic. Instead, it would be best if you used a guide for that.

Writing a guide and a concept article are not mutually exclusive. Instead,
you should, in most cases, write both, where the concept gives a brief overview
of what it is, and the guide is a longer article explaining best practices on using
it.

E.g.:
Concept: Event Bus
Guide: Interacting with the Event Bus


=== Writing tips:
- Write in the present tense
- Use neutral pronouns (they/them instead of he/she and him/her)
- Be respectful to everyone
- Be aware of the potential for cultural misunderstandings

<!-- Brief Description (1-3 lines) of the concept: -->

Traits add new features to your Java class by providing default implementations
you can then "import".

## Basic explanation

Traits are essentially nothing more than Java interfaces. They provide default
methods to the implementing class or interface. You can "import" traits via the
`implements` statement in your class definition.

The difference between traits and normal Java interfaces are essentially that a
trait adds features without forcing the implementing class to
overwrite/implement the defined methods like normal interfaces would do.

After importing a trait you have access to the provided methods from the trait
in your current scope.

Take a look at the following example for a better understanding:

## A basic logging trait

Imagine you have a class that wants to log a message to the console:

```java title="MyClass.java"
public class MyClass {
	public void addNumbers() {
		int sum = 1 + 2;
		// that's tedious
		// and where's the classname in front of the logging message?
		System.out.printf("The sum is %d", sum);
	}
}
```

And you have a trait to support the requested feature:

```java title="WithLogging.java"
public interface WithLogging {
	default void log(String format, Object ...args) {
		System.out.print(getClass().getName() + ": ");
		System.out.printf(format, args);
	}
}
```

You can now implement the `WithLogging` by using the default implemented method
`log`:

```java title="MyClass.java" {1,4}
public class MyClass implements WithLogging {
	public void addNumbers() {
		int sum = 1 + 2;
		log("The sum is %d", sum);
	}
}
```

## Conventions

The name of a trait usually contains the prefix `With` and an action call
describing what the trait provides to the implementing class or interface. For
example:

- `WithLogging`
- `WithEventBus`
- `WithTiming`
- ...
