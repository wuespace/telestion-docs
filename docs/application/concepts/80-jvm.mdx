Concept
=======

=== When to use this template:
Use this template when you need to describe a concept, technology,
or something similar. In other words: whenever you need to write an
article that describes a concept where the concept's name can be the
article's title (e.g., "Vert. x", "Verticle", "Event Bus")

=== When not to use this template:
Do not use these templates for articles that give context on how
to use/approach the topic. Instead, it would be best if you used a guide for that.

Writing a guide and a concept article are not mutually exclusive. Instead,
you should, in most cases, write both, where the concept gives a brief overview
of what it is, and the guide is a longer article explaining best practices on using
it.

E.g.:
Concept: Event Bus
Guide: Interacting with the Event Bus


=== Writing tips:
- Write in the present tense
- Use neutral pronouns (they/them instead of he/she and him/her)
- Be respectful to everyone
- Be aware of the potential for cultural misunderstandings

<!-- Brief Description (1-3 lines) of the concept: -->

The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is an additional layer between the Java source code (in ˋ.javaˋ files) and the compiler
generated executable files.  
It serves the purpose of combining the advantages of a scripting language (mainly platform independent code) with the speed of compiled languages.
For this reason, Java code is translated into "Byte Code" that quicker to process by machines.
