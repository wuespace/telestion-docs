Concept

=== When to use this template:
Use this template when you need to describe a concept, technology,
or something similar. In other words: whenever you need to write an
article that describes a concept where the concept's name can be the
article's title (e.g., "Vert. x", "Verticle", "Event Bus")

=== When not to use this template:
Do not use these templates for articles that give context on how
to use/approach the topic. Instead, it would be best if you used a guide for that.

Writing a guide and a concept article are not mutually exclusive. Instead,
you should, in most cases, write both, where the concept gives a brief overview
of what it is, and the guide is a longer article explaining best practices on using
it.

E.g.:
Concept: Event Bus
Guide: Interacting with the Event Bus


=== Writing tips:
- Write in the present tense
- Use neutral pronouns (they/them instead of he/she and him/her)
- Be respectful to everyone
- Be aware of the potential for cultural misunderstandings

<!-- Brief Description (1-3 lines) of the concept: -->

Records are immutable data classes used in Java to encapsulate "packets" of
data.

Records make it much easier to implement these kinds of "wrapper classes"
without having to define constructors, `toString()`, getters, etc., every single
time.

## Example code

<!-- if applicable -->

````java
public record Car(String engine, String brand) {
    public String brandAsLowerCase() {
        return brand().toLowerCase();
    }
}
````

This, automatically, also creates getters `String engine()` and `String brand()`
on `Car` objects.

You can create an instance of a Record just like with any other class:

````java
var car = new Car("my engine", "Porsche");

System.out.println(car.engine());
````

## `JsonMessage`

One area where the Telestion ecosystem uses records is for JSON object
[Event Bus](/application/concepts/event-bus) messages. This adds type safety
around event bus messages and thus makes them easier to handle.

## `TelestionConfiguration`

Another area where Records are useful within the Telestion ecosystem is Verticle
configuration.
