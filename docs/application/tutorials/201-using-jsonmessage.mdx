Tutorial
========

=== When to use this template:
Use this template when you want to give a quick, step-by-step tutorial for solving a specific
technical problem. Tutorials allow the reader to learn how to implement something within
their projects quickly.

=== When not to use this template:
When your article focuses more on a concept/technology and is not rooted in a specific technical
problem ("how to do XY?"), consider using a guide instead.

=== Guide or Tutorial
A tutorial provides a quick, technical "step-by-step" tutorial for a
given problem. Thus, a guide describes less the handling of a specific problem
and more the general interaction of the reader with a given concept.

Example with npm articles:
- "npm": (Concept, explaining what npm is)
- "Installing a dependency with npm" (Tutorial, providing a quick tutorial to
  solve a technical problem)
- "Managing dependencies with npm" (Guide, including both technical knowledge, but
  also best practices and more)

=== Writing tips:
- Write in the present tense
- Use neutral pronouns (they/them instead of he/she and him/her)
- Be respectful to everyone
- Be aware of the potential for cultural misunderstandings
- Provide explanations for what you do, but focus on the step-by-step guide
  without deeply explaining every technical decision and why it's best prcatice
  to do so (you can describe best practices in a guide, a tutorial must focus on
  keeping the "step by step" flow going)

<!-- Short description of what the article covers: -->

In this tutorial, we extend our basic Verticle by using the `JsonMessage` APIs
from the `telestion-core` packages to get some type safety in event bus
messages.

:::info Prerequisites

To complete this tutorial, you should be familiar with Records in Java and how
to write basic Verticles.

:::

## What we'll build

We will extend the code from [Writing a Verticle](./writing-a-verticle.mdx) with
the `JsonMessage` APIs. This stops us from having to guess about the type of
message sent and therefore poses much fewer edge cases we may need to handle.

It is also highly compatible with various event bus bridges, for example
allowing to exchange these messages with web clients.

:::tip When not to use `JsonMessage`

It sometimes makes sense to drop type safety and instead handle "raw" JSON. In
these cases, you should use the raw Jackson JSON APIs (like `JsonObject`) and
send serialized forms via the event bus (to ensure compatibility with event bus
bridges).

One case where this might make sense is when you handle arbitrary input data
that doesn't necesserily have fixed types.

:::

<Reference to="./writing-a-verticle">Writing a Verticle (Base Code)</Reference>

```java title='IntegerMessage.java'
package de.wuespace.telestion.project.example;

import com.fasterxml.jackson.annotation.JsonProperty;
import de.wuespace.telestion.api.message.JsonMessage;

record IntegerMessage(
		@JsonProperty int value
) implements JsonMessage {}
```

```java title='MessageTransformer.java' {9,16-25}
package de.wuespace.telestion.project.example;

// [...]

public class MessageTransformer extends AbstractVerticle {
  public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
		// [...]

		vertx.eventBus().publish("input", new IntegerMessage(3).json());
	}

	@Override
	public void start() throws Exception {
		var eb = getVertx().eventBus();

		eb.consumer("input", event ->
				JsonMessage.on(IntegerMessage.class, event,
						message ->
						{
							int received = message.value();
							var output = new IntegerMessage(received * 2);
							eb.publish("output", output.json());
						}
				)
		);
	}
}
```

## Step 1: Creating the `record`

The first thing we need to do is to create the _message container_, a `record`
that contains our message data.

In this case, we'll just expand upon our "integer processor" and create a record
that simply holds one integer value.

Create a file `IntegerMessage.java` in the
`de.wuespace.telestion.project.example` package and add the following code:

```java title='IntegerMessage.java'
package de.wuespace.telestion.project.example;

import com.fasterxml.jackson.annotation.JsonProperty;
import de.wuespace.telestion.api.message.JsonMessage;

record IntegerMessage(
		@JsonProperty int value
) implements JsonMessage {}
```

The two _special ingredients_ to make this a `JsonMessage` are:

- declaring that it implements the
  `de.wuespace.telestion.api.message.JsonMessage` interface
- marking its attribute(/-s) as JSON properties using the `@JsonProperty`
  decorator

Now, we can begin using our `IntegerMessage` with the Telestion APIs.

## Step 2: Listening for messages of that class

Since we now have a proper `JsonMessage` wrapper, we can drop the previous
"casting to `int`" from the raw `Object message.body()` in our consumer and can,
instead, use one of Telestion's convenience functions for easily filtering for
valid messages.

Replace our previous `eb.consumer()` logic in `MessageTransformer::start()` with
this code:

```java title='MessageTransformer.java' {12-20}
package de.wuespace.telestion.project.example;

// [...]

public class MessageTransformer extends AbstractVerticle {
	// [...]

	@Override
	public void start() throws Exception {
		var eb = getVertx().eventBus();

		eb.consumer("input", event ->
				JsonMessage.on(IntegerMessage.class, event,
						message ->
						{
							int received = message.value();
							eb.publish("output", received * 2);
						}
				)
		);
	}
}
```

Instead of handling the `event` directly, we pass it into the `JsonMessage.on()`
function. This, then, filters messages and calls a handler passed into it if and
only if the message type matches the specified class (here: `IntegerMessage`).

The first argument to the handler, `message`, then is the already deserialized
instance of `IntegerMessage` and we can, therefore, use it to further process
the data.

In this case, we use `message.value()` to retrieve the `value` field within the
record. Since we already know that it's of the type `IntegerMessage` where
`value` is an integer, we no longer need to cast any types or handle other edge
cases.

## Step 3: Publishing messages

Now that we can receive `IntegerMessage` messages, we also need to publish them.

Create a new `IntegerMessage` instance called `output` and instead of publishing
`received * 2`, publish `output.json()`:

```java title='MessageTransformer.java' {15-16}
// [...]

public class MessageTransformer extends AbstractVerticle {
	// [...]

	@Override
	public void start() throws Exception {
		var eb = getVertx().eventBus();

		eb.consumer("input", event ->
				JsonMessage.on(IntegerMessage.class, event,
						message ->
						{
							int received = message.value();
							var output = new IntegerMessage(received * 2);
							eb.publish("output", output.json());
						}
				)
		);
	}
}
```

:::warning Calling `.json()`

To use the `JsonMessage` APIs when publishing a message, you must publish the
result of calling `.json()` on your `JsonMessage`. This converts its contents to
a JSON `String` that can get parsed on the receiving end.

:::

Now, all we need to do to test our code is to also publish an `IntegerMessage`
within our `main()` method using the same method as above:

```java title='MessageTransformer.java' {7}
// [...]

public class MessageTransformer extends AbstractVerticle {
  public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
        // [...]

        vertx.eventBus().publish("input", new IntegerMessage(3).json());
    }

	// [...]
}
```

When you now re-run our `main()` method, you should get the following output:

```txt
Output: {"value":6,"className":"de.wuespace.telestion.project.example.IntegerMessage"}
```

:::tip `className` attribute

As you can see, `JsonMessage` instances automatically encode a `className`
attribute into the encoded JSON. This allows our helper functions to verify and
automatically re-instantiate it with the correct class type.

:::

## Next steps

<!-- Short concluding sentence: -->

With that, you've used your first actual Telestion API. And you've gotten away
from nasty, unsafe type casts.

In the next tutorial, you'll learn how to add configuration options to your
verticle. After that, you're already equipped with the knowledge to understand
almost all real Verticles in Telestion projects.
