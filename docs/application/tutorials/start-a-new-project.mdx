Tutorial
========

=== When to use this template:
Use this template when you want to give a quick, step-by-step tutorial for solving a specific
technical problem. Tutorials allow the reader to learn how to implement something within
their projects quickly.

=== When not to use this template:
When your article focuses more on a concept/technology and is not rooted in a specific technical
problem ("how to do XY?"), consider using a guide instead.

=== Guide or Tutorial
A tutorial provides a quick, technical "step-by-step" tutorial for a
given problem. Thus, a guide describes less the handling of a specific problem
and more the general interaction of the reader with a given concept.

Example with npm articles:
- "npm": (Concept, explaining what npm is)
- "Installing a dependency with npm" (Tutorial, providing a quick tutorial to
  solve a technical problem)
- "Managing dependencies with npm" (Guide, including both technical knowledge, but
  also best practices and more)

=== Writing tips:
- Write in the present tense
- Use neutral pronouns (they/them instead of he/she and him/her)
- Be respectful to everyone
- Be aware of the potential for cultural misunderstandings
- Provide explanations for what you do, but focus on the step-by-step guide
  without deeply explaining every technical decision and why it's best prcatice
  to do so (you can describe best practices in a guide, a tutorial must focus on
  keeping the "step by step" flow going)

<!-- Short description of what the article covers: -->

In this tutorial, we start a new Telestion Project based on the provided template.

:::info Prerequisites

To complete this tutorial, you should be familiar with the functionality of Git and the usage of GitHub templates 
as well as the GitHub web interface.

:::

## What we'll build

A "ready to implement" project for your specific groundstation-related problem.

## Step 1: Create a new Project repository

First, log into GitHub with your user account.

Head to our project template and press the `Use this template button`.

<Reference to="https://github.com/wuespace/telestion-project-template">
  Telestion Project Template
</Reference>

<Image src="/img/new-project/github-use-this-template.png" alt="GitHub's Use this template button" />

Now, GitHub asks you some required information.
Select a suitable user/group and give the repository a meaningful name.

Next, select your repository's visibility.
When you are satisfied with your information, press the `Create repository from template` button.

That's it!

## Step 2: Initialize the new project

Now, you should have a new repository under your control.

Next, initialize the Telestion project.
Our template already has a GitHub Action configuration that does the initialization steps for you.

Go to the `Actions` tab and select the `Initialize` in the left sidebar.

<Image src="/img/new-project/github-actions-initialize.png" alt="GitHub Actions page with the selected Initialize action" />

Now press the `Run workflow` button in the Action list.
In the popup, enter your preferences and then press `Run workflow`.

:::tip Java package naming

We recommend following the
[Maven Central `groupId` naming conventions](https://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-naming-conventions.html), 
e.g., beginning with the company URL in reverse.
