Tutorial
========

=== When to use this template:
Use this template when you want to give a quick, step-by-step tutorial for solving a specific
technical problem. Tutorials allow the reader to learn how to implement something within
their projects quickly.

=== When not to use this template:
When your article focuses more on a concept/technology and is not rooted in a specific technical
problem ("how to do XY?"), consider using a guide instead.

=== Guide or Tutorial
A tutorial provides a quick, technical "step-by-step" tutorial for a
given problem. Thus, a guide describes less the handling of a specific problem
and more the general interaction of the reader with a given concept.

Example with npm articles:
- "npm": (Concept, explaining what npm is)
- "Installing a dependency with npm" (Tutorial, providing a quick tutorial to
  solve a technical problem)
- "Managing dependencies with npm" (Guide, including both technical knowledge, but
  also best practices and more)

=== Writing tips:
- Write in the present tense
- Use neutral pronouns (they/them instead of he/she and him/her)
- Be respectful to everyone
- Be aware of the potential for cultural misunderstandings
- Provide explanations for what you do, but focus on the step-by-step guide
  without deeply explaining every technical decision and why it's best prcatice
  to do so (you can describe best practices in a guide, a tutorial must focus on
  keeping the "step by step" flow going)

<!-- Short description of what the article covers: -->

In this tutorial, you'll start a new Telestion Project based on the provided
template.

:::info Prerequisites

To complete this tutorial, you should be familiar with the features of Git and
the usage of GitHub templates as well as the GitHub web interface.

:::

## What you'll build

A "ready to implement" project for your specific groundstation-related problem.

## Using GitHub

### Step 1: Create a new Project repository

First, log into GitHub with your user account.

Head to the Telestion project template and press the `Use this template button`.

<Reference to="https://github.com/wuespace/telestion-project-template">
	Telestion Project Template
</Reference>

<Image
	src="/img/new-project/github-use-this-template.png"
	alt="GitHub's Use this template button"
/>

Now, GitHub asks you some required information. Select a suitable user/group and
give the repository a meaningful name.

Next, select your repository's visibility. When you're happy with your
information, press the `Create repository from template` button.

<Image
	src="/img/new-project/github-create-repo.png"
	alt="GitHub's Create repository from template interface"
/>

That's it.

### Step 2: Initialize the new project

Now, you should have a new repository under your control.

Next, initialize the Telestion project. The template already has a GitHub Action
configuration that does the initialization steps for you.

Go to the `Actions` tab and select the `Initialize` in the left sidebar.

<Image
	src="/img/new-project/github-actions-initialize.png"
	alt="GitHub Actions page with the selected Initialize action"
/>

Now press the `Run workflow` button in the Action list. In the popup, enter your
preferences and then press `Run workflow`.

	alt="Open popup to run the Initialize workflow in GitHub Actions"
/>

:::tip Java package naming

You should follow the
[Maven Central `groupId` naming conventions](https://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-naming-conventions.html),
for example, beginning with the company URL in reverse.

:::

## Manually

### Step 1: Create an empty git repository

Open your console and create a new git repository:

````shell
mkdir my-telestion-project
cd my-telestion-project
git init
````

### Step 2: Import the template

Fetch the latest changes from our Project Template:

````shell
git fetch --depth=1 -n "https://github.com/wuespace/telestion-project-template.git"
````

<Reference to="https://github.com/wuespace/telestion-project-template">
	Telestion Project Template
</Reference>

Use the last commit as your starting point:

````shell
git reset --hard "$(git commit-tree FETCH_HEAD^{tree} -m "feat: Initial commit")"
````

### Step 3: Initialize the project

Run the provided initialization script:

````shell
./scripts/initialize.sh
````

The script asks if things are unclear or cannot be recognized automatically.

:::tip Explicit inputs

You can also provide the information via command line parameters. Run
`./scripts/initializate.sh --help` for more information.

:::

As suggested by the script, commit the initialization changes:

````shell
git add .
git commit -m 'feat: Initialize project'
````

### (Optional) Step 4: Push to a remote repository

If you have a remote repository at your hand, you can add it as the default
remote of the new Telestion Project:

````shell
git remote add origin "git@gitlab.com:your-name/my-telestion-project.git"
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
````

## Next steps

<!-- Short concluding sentence: -->

That's it. Now, you have a new Telestion Project ready for development.
