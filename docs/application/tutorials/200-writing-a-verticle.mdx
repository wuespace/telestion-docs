import { Reference, Image } from '/components';

In this tutorial, you'll write a simple
[Verticle](/application/concepts/verticle) for the Telestion ecosystem.

:::info Prerequisites

To complete this tutorial, you should be familiar with standard Java programming
structures. You also need to have a Telestion Project repository set up on your
machine.

:::

## What you'll build

In this tutorial, you'll build a basic Verticle that listens for a message
containing a number on a specific channel and republishes the number times two
on another channel.

In real applications, this could, for example, transform incoming Telemetry data
into a suitable format for the database.

The full code for this tutorial looks like this:

```java title='MessageTransformer.java'
package de.wuespace.telestion.project.example;

import de.wuespace.telestion.api.verticle.GenericConfiguration;
import de.wuespace.telestion.api.verticle.TelestionVerticle;

public class MessageTransformer extends TelestionVerticle<GenericConfiguration> {
	@Override
	public void onStart() {
		var eb = vertx.eventBus();

		eb.consumer("input", event -> {
			var received = (int) event.body(); // cast body to integer
			eb.publish("output", received * 2); // republish
		});
	}
}
```

## Steps

### Step 1: Create a new Verticle

A _Verticle_ is nothing else than a Java class that extends the
`de.wuespace.telestion.api.verticle.TelestionVerticle` class.

Therefore, to create a new Verticle, the first thing you need to do is to create
a new class. This tutorial assumes that you're working in the
`de.wuespace.telestion.project.example` package.

Within that package, create a new class called `MessageTransformer` and paste
the following code:

```java title='MessageTransformer.java'
package de.wuespace.telestion.project.example;

import de.wuespace.telestion.api.verticle.GenericConfiguration;
import de.wuespace.telestion.api.verticle.TelestionVerticle;

public class MessageTransformer extends TelestionVerticle<GenericConfiguration> {
	@Override
	public void onStart() {
		// your code goes here
	}
}
```

### Step 2: Listen to messages

Basically, every Verticle's main functionality is to listen for messages on the
so-called [event bus](/application/concepts/event-bus), process them, and
potentially publish new information to the event bus.

Messages on the event bus are "grouped" on so-called channels that are
identified by their address (a `String`):

<Image
	src="/img/drawio-diagrams/vertx/eventbus.drawio.svg"
	alt="Diagram that shows two Verticles publishing to a bus with an address 'xy' and 
one Verticle receiving messages from that bus"
	invertible
	center
/>

For now, keep it simple and listen to the `"input"` channel:

```java title='MessageTransformer.java' {9,11-14}
package de.wuespace.telestion.project.example;

import de.wuespace.telestion.api.verticle.GenericConfiguration;
import de.wuespace.telestion.api.verticle.TelestionVerticle;

public class MessageTransformer extends TelestionVerticle<GenericConfiguration> {
	@Override
	public void onStart() {
		var eb = vertx.eventBus();

		eb.consumer("input", event -> {
			var received = (int) event.body(); // cast body to integer
			// further process the received value
		});
	}
}
```

This first gets an instance to the Event Bus APIs using `vertx.eventBus()`.

Then, using `eb.consumer(address, handler)`, this registers a `handler` that
reacts to messages on the channel with the address `address`.

The first argument to that `handler(message)` callback is the `message` which
contains all information about the message, including the body, optional
headers, and more.

You can get the message's body by calling its `body()` method. Since this
returns an `Object` (containing whatever we published to that channel), you need
to cast it to an integer.

:::tip Body data type

For this simple example, we chose to send simple integers over the event bus.

This isn't ideal for several reasons, including missing type safety (our
Verticle could fail if we sent something to `"input"` that Java can't cast to
`int`).

In the later sections, you'll learn how to use JSON structures (including the
`JsonMessage` from the `telestion-core` libraries) to properly handle type
safety on the event bus.

You should only ever use JSON based messages in real Telestion projects.

:::

### Step 3: Republish Messages

There are uses for Verticles that only listen to channels without ever
publishing anything themselves. For example, you could write a Verticle that
simply logs all incoming messages to a file or saves them to the database. In
this case, however, you want to transform the data and "republish" it to the
event bus (this time, on a different channel called `"output"`).

Thankfully, the Event Bus APIs make this quite easy using the
`publish(address, body)` method:

```java title='MessageTransformer.java' {13}
package de.wuespace.telestion.project.example;

import de.wuespace.telestion.api.verticle.GenericConfiguration;
import de.wuespace.telestion.api.verticle.TelestionVerticle;

public class MessageTransformer extends TelestionVerticle<GenericConfiguration> {
	@Override
	public void onStart() {
		var eb = vertx.eventBus();

		eb.consumer("input", event -> {
			var received = (int) event.body(); // cast body to integer
			eb.publish("output", received * 2); // republish
		});
	}
}
```

With that, whenever this receives a value `received` on `"input"`, it publishes
`received * 2` to `"output"`.

### Step 4: Test the Verticle

To test Verticles, you can add a `public static void main(String[] args)` method
to the Verticle class that tests the Verticle.

Given the fact that a Verticle, if it's well written, doesn't depend on any
other Verticles, all you need to do to test the Verticle is to spawn it, send
some messages to a channel it listens to and monitor the reaction / messages on
its output channels.

Put theory into practice and write our static `main()` method:

```java title='MessageTransformer.java' {5,9-21}
package de.wuespace.telestion.project.example;

import de.wuespace.telestion.api.verticle.GenericConfiguration;
import de.wuespace.telestion.api.verticle.TelestionVerticle;
import io.vertx.core.Vertx;

public class MessageTransformer extends TelestionVerticle<GenericConfiguration> {

	public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
		var vertx = Vertx.vertx(); // create a new Vertx instance to test on
		// "hear" on the output channel and print out anything
		vertx.eventBus().consumer(
			"output",
			message -> System.out.printf("Output: %s%n", message.body().toString())
		);
		// deploy our Verticle on the vertx instance
		vertx.deployVerticle(new MessageTransformer()).onSuccess(res -> {
			// publish a number once the Verticle is deployed
			vertx.eventBus().publish("input", 3);
		});
	}

  // [...]
}
```

First, you create a `Vertx` instance called `vertx` using `Vertx.vertx()`.

Then, you add a listener on the `"output"` address that just prints
`"Output: [body]"` to the console for every message. You can get an `EventBus`
instance using `vertx.eventBus()` and just use the same APIs we used inside the
Verticle's `onStart()` method to interact with the event bus.

Next, you deploy our `MessageTransformer` Verticle by creating an instance and
hand it over to `Vertx`. This will, in turn, call its `onStart()` method to
deploy the Verticle.

The deployment process returns a future object. When it resolves, you publish a
random number (here: `3`) to the `"input"` channel.

If everything worked out, you should, after a short while, see `Output: 6` in
your console. If it doesn't work, double-check that your code matches the code
on this page.

## Next steps

Congratulations: You've just built your first Verticle. While this might not
seem that impressive, right now, it's the core of everything you'll do when
developing for the Application (Java) side of a Telestion project.

While the "inner functionality" of a Verticle might get more complex in your
projects, the basis always consists of a subset of the following steps:

1. Setup listeners in the Verticle's `onStart()` method
2. Listen for some event (e.g., from the event bus)
3. Process that event
4. Publish new information to the event bus

In the following sections, you can take a look at how to improve your Verticle
by using Telestion's APIs to get type safety in event bus messages, add
configurability to your Verticle (allowing you to re-use it), and more.
