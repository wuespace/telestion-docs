Tutorial
========

=== When to use this template:
Use this template when you want to give a quick, step-by-step tutorial for solving a specific
technical problem. Tutorials allow the reader to learn how to implement something within
their projects quickly.

=== When not to use this template:
When your article focuses more on a concept/technology and is not rooted in a specific technical
problem ("how to do XY?"), consider using a guide instead.

=== Guide or Tutorial
A tutorial provides a quick, technical "step-by-step" tutorial for a
given problem. Thus, a guide describes less the handling of a specific problem
and more the general interaction of the reader with a given concept.

Example with npm articles:
- "npm": (Concept, explaining what npm is)
- "Installing a dependency with npm" (Tutorial, providing a quick tutorial to
  solve a technical problem)
- "Managing dependencies with npm" (Guide, including both technical knowledge, but
  also best practices and more)

=== Writing tips:
- Write in the present tense
- Use neutral pronouns (they/them instead of he/she and him/her)
- Be respectful to everyone
- Be aware of the potential for cultural misunderstandings
- Provide explanations for what you do, but focus on the step-by-step guide
  without deeply explaining every technical decision and why it's best prcatice
  to do so (you can describe best practices in a guide, a tutorial must focus on
  keeping the "step by step" flow going)

<!-- Short description of what the article covers: -->

In this tutorial, you'll write a simple Verticle for the Telestion ecosystem.

:::info Prerequisites

To complete this tutorial, you should be familiar with starting a new project
and the concept of [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).

:::

## What you'll build

You'll create a new release in your project and deploy the application part via
[Docker](https://www.docker.com/).

## Using GitHub

### Step 1: Review the release pull request

Once you're happy with your changes in your Telestion Project, it's time to release
a new version.

Head over to your GitHub repository that contains the Telestion Project
and take a look in the pull request section.

<Image
  src="/img/deploy/github-pull-request-section.png"
  alt="GitHub pull request section"
/>

As you can see, the `release.yml` GitHub workflow automatically created a pull request
that is ready for your review.

<Image
  src="/img/deploy/github-release-pull-request.png"
  alt="GitHub's pull request section containing the release pull request"
/>

Open the pull request and review the changes.

<Image
  src="/img/deploy/github-pull-request-overview.png"
  alt="The overview page of the release pull request"
/>

:::info Conventional Commits

The GitHub action can only detect your changes if you're using the
[Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) in your repository.

It then bumps the project version based on [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

:::

If you satisfied with the changelog and the new project version, merge the pull request.

<Image
  src="/img/deploy/github-merge-pull-request.png"
  alt="The merge pull request button in the GitHub's pull request overview"
/>

:::tip Set release version explicitly

You can overwrite the [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) behavior
by pushing a empty commit containing the version number:

```shell
git commit --allow-empty -m "chore: release 2.0.0" -m "Release-As: 2.0.0"
git push
```

This triggers the `release.yml` workflow and changes the release version to your preference.

:::

The merge commit triggers the `release.yml` workflow again which in turn builds and pushes the application
to the [GitHub Container Registry](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-container-registry).

### Step 2: Access the setup archive

To run the Telestion Project on your production system, a setup archive is required.

Head to the latest release via the link on the project metadata.

<Image
  src="/img/deploy/github-project-metadata.png"
  alt="Metadata sidebar of the GitHub repository"
/>

And download the archive named `<your-project-name>-<tag>.zip`.

<Image
  src="/img/deploy/github-latest-release-downloads.png"
  alt="GitHub's release page with the uploaded artifacts"
/>

Go to the deployment section of this tutorial.

## Manually

### Step 1: Bump project version

Update the project version in the `version.txt` file which resides in the project root.

Next, open the console and commit the version bump:

```shell
git add version.txt
git commit -m "chore(main): release $(<version.txt)"
git tag -a "v$(<version.txt)" -m "release $(<version.txt)"
git push --follow-tags
```

:::danger Semantic Versioning

The deployment scripts and tools require that you use the
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) release style in your project.

:::

:::tip Conventional Commits

Before bumping, you may look at your commit history with:

```shell
git log --oneline "v$(<version.txt)..HEAD"
```

And decide based on [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)
to which version you might bump.

:::

### Step 2: Build the application

Before pushing the release image to docker, you need to build the application part.

Open your IDE and select the `assembleDist` task in the `distribution` section of Gradle.

Or run the Gradle task in your console:

```shell
cd application
JAVA_HOME="<path-to-jdk16>" ./gradlew assembleDist
cd ..
```

### Step 3: Build and push the Docker images

Now, build and push the Docker images:

```shell
./scripts/push-docker-images.sh
```

The script asks if things are unclear or cannot be recognized automatically.

:::info Docker Login

The deployment script uses the Docker CLI to push the images to specified Docker registry.
You probably need to login before you can push the images.

Take a look at the [Docker login reference](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/login/)
on how you can login in the console.

:::

:::tip Specify another registry

By default, the script pushes the images to the [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/),
the official Docker registry.

If you would like to push to a different registry instead, use the `--docker-registry <registry-uri>`
flag to specify the Docker registry explicitly.

See the script help for more information:

```shell
./scripts/push-docker-images.sh --help
```

:::

### Step 4: Create the setup archive

Now, the Docker images are available on your preferred registry.
Lets create the setup archive you can then deploy on your production system.

Open the console and run the create setup script:

```shell
./scripts/create-setup.sh
```

The script asks if things are unclear or cannot be recognized automatically.

It creates a setup archive and place it in the `build` folder which resides in the project root.

## Deploy on your production system

Before running Telestion on your production system, you need a working Docker and docker-compose installation.

<Reference to="https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/">
  Install Docker
</Reference>

<Reference to="https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/">
  Install docker-compose
</Reference>

You should received a copy of the setup archive of the Telestion Project you want to deploy.

Copy it to your production system and extract it via:

```shell
unzip my-telestion-project-v1.3.0.zip
```

Head into the folder which contains the `docker-compose.yml` and start Telestion:

```shell
docker-compose up -d
```

This downloads and starts the required components to run Telestion.

If you want to stop Telestion, call:

```shell
docker-compose down
```

## Next steps

<!-- Short concluding sentence: -->

Congratulations: You've just deployed your first Telestion Project.

You can configure the deployed Telestion Project via the configuration files in the `conf` folder
beside the `docker-compose.yml` and restart it if you like.

You might also want to use a graphical interface to interact with the running application.

Take a look at our tutorials for the Web Client.
