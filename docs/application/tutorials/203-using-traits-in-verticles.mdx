Tutorial
========

=== When to use this template:
Use this template when you want to give a quick, step-by-step tutorial for solving a specific
technical problem. Tutorials allow the reader to learn how to implement something within
their projects quickly.

=== When not to use this template:
When your article focuses more on a concept/technology and is not rooted in a specific technical
problem ("how to do XY?"), consider using a guide instead.

=== Guide or Tutorial
A tutorial provides a quick, technical "step-by-step" tutorial for a
given problem. Thus, a guide describes less the handling of a specific problem
and more the general interaction of the reader with a given concept.

Example with npm articles:
- "npm": (Concept, explaining what npm is)
- "Installing a dependency with npm" (Tutorial, providing a quick tutorial to
	solve a technical problem)
- "Managing dependencies with npm" (Guide, including both technical knowledge, but
	also best practices and more)

=== Writing tips:
- Write in the present tense
- Use neutral pronouns (they/them instead of he/she and him/her)
- Be respectful to everyone
- Be aware of the potential for cultural misunderstandings
- Provide explanations for what you do, but focus on the step-by-step guide
	without deeply explaining every technical decision and why it's best prcatice
	to do so (you can describe best practices in a guide, a tutorial must focus on
	keeping the "step by step" flow going)

<!-- Short description of what the article covers: -->

It's tedious to do common tasks in Verticles like registering event handlers or
publishing `JsonMessage` based messages.

Doing this over and over again in your Verticle the code becomes bloated and
unreadable.

Provide a better reading experience using traits in your Verticle.

:::info Prerequisites

To complete this tutorial, you should be familiar with writing basic Verticles
and using the `JsonMessage` interface from the Telestion APIs.

:::

## What you'll build

<Reference to="/application/tutorials/using-jsonmessage/">Base Code</Reference>

Based on the code from the
[`JsonMessage` tutorial](/application/tutorials/using-jsonmessage/), you'll add
traits to your `MessageTransformer` Verticle.

For a concept on what a trait actually is, please take a look on this concept:

<Reference to="/application/concepts/traits/">Traits concept</Reference>

After the tutorial, your Verticle looks like this:

```java title='MessageTransformer.java' {5,7-8,16,18,19}
package de.wuespace.telestion.project.example;

import de.wuespace.telestion.api.verticle.GenericConfiguration;
import de.wuespace.telestion.api.verticle.TelestionVerticle;
import de.wuespace.telestion.api.verticle.trait.WithEventBus;

public class MessageTransformer extends TelestionVerticle<GenericConfiguration>
		implements WithEventBus {

	public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
		// [...]
	}

	@Override
	public void onStart() {
		register("input", message -> {
			int received = message.value();
			publish("output", new IntegerMessage(received * 2));
		}, IntegerMessage.class);
	}
}
```

## Step 1: Add a trait to our Verticle

The Telestion API already provides some traits especially for Verticles.

<Reference to="https://javadoc.io/doc/de.wuespace.telestion/telestion-api/latest/de/wuespace/telestion/api/verticle/trait/package-summary.html">
	List of Telestion Core Verticle traits
</Reference>

Import the `WithEventBus` trait and use it in your `MessageTransformer`
Verticle:

```java title='MessageTransformer.java' {5,7-8}
package de.wuespace.telestion.project.example;

import de.wuespace.telestion.api.verticle.GenericConfiguration;
import de.wuespace.telestion.api.verticle.TelestionVerticle;
import de.wuespace.telestion.api.verticle.trait.WithEventBus;

public class MessageTransformer extends TelestionVerticle<GenericConfiguration>
		implements WithEventBus {

	public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
		// [...]
	}

	@Override
	public void onStart() {
		// [...]
	}
}
```

The `WithEventBus` trait contains a bunch of methods to interact with the
[`EventBus`](/application/concepts/event-bus/).

For more information, take a look at the API reference:

<Reference to="https://javadoc.io/doc/de.wuespace.telestion/telestion-api/latest/de/wuespace/telestion/api/verticle/trait/WithEventBus.html">
	`WithEventBus` API reference
</Reference>

## Step 2: Rewrite the event bus consumer

Currently the Verticle extracts the event bus instance from the `vertx` context
and registers an event handler and an event bus channel. The incoming message is
then converted to an `IntegerMessage` if possible and another event handler is
called which multiplies the received value.

That's a tedious task especially if you want to consume messages on multiple
channels throughout your Verticle.

Use the `register` method from the `WithEventBus`:

```java title='MessageTransformer.java' {18-20}
package de.wuespace.telestion.project.example;

import de.wuespace.telestion.api.verticle.GenericConfiguration;
import de.wuespace.telestion.api.verticle.TelestionVerticle;
import de.wuespace.telestion.api.verticle.trait.WithEventBus;

public class MessageTransformer extends TelestionVerticle<GenericConfiguration>
		implements WithEventBus {

	public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
		// [...]
	}

	@Override
	public void onStart() {
		var eb = vertx.eventBus();

		register("input", message -> {
			// [...]
		}, IntegerMessage.class);
	}
}
```

The `register` method combines multiple operations in one call. First, it
registers an event handler on the event bus channel `"input"`. If a messages
arrives at the channel the `register` method tries to convert received message
to the specified message type (here `IntegerMessage.class`). If the conversion
succeeded, `register` calls the given event handler with the converted message.

In short, it has the same behaviour as the already existing implementation but
is much more readable and maintainable.

## Step 3: Rewrite the event bus publisher

To completely eliminate the `eb` event bus reference, you can use the `publish`
method also provided by the `WithEventBus` trait:

```java title='MessageTransformer.java' {17-18}
package de.wuespace.telestion.project.example;

import de.wuespace.telestion.api.verticle.GenericConfiguration;
import de.wuespace.telestion.api.verticle.TelestionVerticle;
import de.wuespace.telestion.api.verticle.trait.WithEventBus;

public class MessageTransformer extends TelestionVerticle<GenericConfiguration>
		implements WithEventBus {

	public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
		// [...]
	}

	@Override
	public void onStart() {
		register("input", message -> {
			int received = message.value();
			publish("output", new IntegerMessage(received * 2));
		}, IntegerMessage.class);
	}
}
```

The `publish` is essentially a shorthand to access the
`vertx.eventBus().publish()` method.

One neat feature of `publish` is that it does the conversion from a
`JsonMessage` based message back to the `JsonObject` automatically. So you don't
need to call `.json()` on the message anymore. (as described in
[Using `JsonMessage`](/application/tutorials/using-jsonmessage/#step-3-publishing-messages))

## Next steps

<!-- Short concluding sentence: -->

That's it. You've successfully using traits in your first Verticle! üçπ

Althrough it doesn't look like much of an improvement right now, it really
cleans up your code in bigger and complexer Verticles.

But that's not the end. The Telestion Core provides more traits for Verticles.
Take a look at them if you like.

You can also write your own traits not only for Verticles but much more types.
