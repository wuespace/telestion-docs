=== When to use this template:
Use this template when you want to explain how to work with a specific technology/concept.

=== When not to use this template:
When
- the article provides a quick explanation of a single concept (use a concept instead)
- the article should be a quick way to look things up (use a reference instead)
- the article focuses on how to solve a particular technical problem (use a tutorial instead)

=== Guide or Tutorial
A tutorial provides a quick, technical "step-by-step" tutorial for a
given problem. Thus, a guide describes less the handling of a specific problem
and more the general interaction of the reader with a given concept.

Example with npm articles:
- "npm": (Concept, explaining what npm is)
- "Installing a dependency with npm" (Tutorial, providing a quick tutorial to
  solve a technical problem)
- "Managing dependencies with npm" (Guide, including both technical knowledge, but
  also best practices and more)

=== Writing tips:
- Write in the present tense
- Use neutral pronouns (they/them instead of he/she and him/her)
- Be respectful to everyone
- Be aware of the potential for cultural misunderstandings
- Guides are more comprehensive than many other article types.
  Feel free to add context and best practices.
- Mention common pitfalls and how not to use something (and why)

## Before implementing your own trait

Before you implement your trait, first sit back and think about the following
questions:

### What specific problem wants your trait to solve?

First, write down the scope of your problem and try to slice it up into
specialized feature sets. One great feature of Java interfaces is that you can
import more than one of them at once. "Importing" more than one interface keeps
a trait's source file small, readable and maintainable.

It's not a good idea to push every feature into one giant trait. Too big traits
bloat the implementing class and pollute the class's namespace, which can create
name collisions.

### Are there existing interfaces or traits you can use to support your trait?

Most of the time, you want to write a trait is when you implement the same
feature over and over again in different parts of your Application. The
maintenance of your code shrinks, and you don't have the ultimate source of
truth because two or more implementations diverged at some point.

Try to find these implementations and look at what features you use. Is there an
existing interface or trait that you can extend? If that's the case, that's
great because you can keep your source code footprint small and maintainable.

### Are there other users that want to use your trait in a different context?

It's already handy to write a trait for your specialized context. It becomes
even more helpful when you can re-use it in a lot of places at once. But what if
your trait is so restrictive that you cannot re-use it elsewhere?

Try to think about a greater context of your trait and where you can use it.
Another neat feature of Java is method overloading. You can define more than one
method with the same name but different argument sets. Then, the compiler
automatically selects the most suitable method for the problem you want to solve
with your imported trait.

Then you can extend your specialized method by adding more methods with a
different and broader set of arguments.

The user of your trait thanks you later. ðŸ˜‰

### Decision

If you don't understand all things right away, that's okay. Take a look at the
example below for better understanding.

## Example implementation of a trait

### The problem

Imagine having more than one verticle that use the `vertx.eventBus()` context. They
use `JsonMessage` based messages to communicate with each other.

Thus, they need to convert the received messages to the wanted `"JsonMessage"`
type every time.

For example:

```java title="Responder.java"
public class Responder extends TelestionVerticle<GenericConfiguration> {
  @Override
  public void onStart() {
    var eb = vertx.eventBus();

    eb.consumer("some-address", message -> {
      JsonMessage.on(SpecialMessage.class, message, body -> {
        logger.debug("Received: {}", body);

        // do some calcuation or change something
        var result = new SpecialMessage(/* [...] */);

        message.reply(result.json());
        eb.publish("update-address", result.json());
      });
    });
  }
}
```

```java title="Repeater.java"
public class Repeater extends TelestionVerticle<GenericConfiguration> {
  @Override
  public void onStart() {
    var eb = vertx.eventBus();
    var delay = Duration.ofSeconds(1).toMillis();

    vertx.setInterval(delay, id -> {
      var message = new PingMessage();

      var options = new DeliveryOptions();
      var headers = options.getHeaders()
          .add("send-time", System.currentTimeInMillis());

      eb.publish("ping-address", message.json(), options);
    });
  }
}
```

```java title="Rerequester.java"
public class Rerequester extends TelestionVerticle<GenericConfiguration> {
  @Override
  public void onStart() {
    var eb = vertx.eventBus();

    eb.consumer("request-address", message -> {
      JsonMessage.on(RequestMessage.class, message, request -> {
        // okay, we received a request message, we need another request
        var internalRequest = new InternalMessage(request);
        eb.request("internal-address", internalRequest.json(), result -> {
          if (!result.failed()) {
            message.reply(result.result());
          } else {
            message.fail(500, "Ohh something went wrong.");
          }
        });
      });
    });
  }
}
```

Do you see the repetition?

You can do that better. Let's introduce a trait that allows verticles to get
better and simpler access to the event bus.

### Defining the trait

You need a name for your new trait. What's about `WithEventBus`?

Okay, let's define it:

```java title="WithEventBus.java"
public interface WithEventBus {
}
```

Hmm, how do you get access to the event bus instance? Traits should not force
the using class to implement a function.

Every Verticle implements the `Verticle` interface. That's your access point.

<Reference to="https://vertx.io/docs/apidocs/io/vertx/core/Verticle.html">
	`Verticle` API reference
</Reference>

Add it to your existing implementation:

```java title="WithEventBus.java" {1}
public interface WithEventBus extends Verticle {
}
```

:::tip Exposed interfaces

Many exposed types on the Vert.x framework are Java interfaces. The
implementation side of Vert.x often imports these. If you want to write traits
for Verticles and other types, these interfaces are your intercept point.

:::

### The `publish` method

Now you have the definition of your trait, let's add the first method:

```java title="WithEventBus.java" {2-4}
public interface WithEventBus extends Verticle {
  default void publish(String address, Object message) {
    getVertx().eventBus().publish(address, message);
  }
}
```

You start with the publishing part and add a method to publish messages on a
specific event bus channel.

That's an improvement because the Verticle doesn't need to extract the event bus
instance anymore. But what's with the `JsonMessage` based messages. You must
convert them to `JsonObject` before transmitting them over the event bus.

Overload the `publish` method to handle `JsonMessage` messages in a special way:

```java title="WithEventBus.java" {6-8}
public interface WithEventBus extends Verticle {
  default void publish(String address, Object message) {
    getVertx().eventBus().publish(address, message);
  }

  default void publish(String address, JsonMessage message) {
    publish(address, message.json());
  }
}
```

The overloaded method only accepts `JsonMessage` as a message type, so you are
safe to call `json()` on it to convert it to a `JsonObject`. Then you pass the
arguments further to the base method.

Now the user of your trait cannot forget the conversion anyone because you do
it. That's convenient.

Now we repeat this step with the call method call but you want to provide
delivery options, too:

```java title="WithEventBus.java" {6-8,14-16}
public interface WithEventBus extends Verticle {
  default void publish(String address, Object message) {
    getVertx().eventBus().publish(address, message);
  }

  default void publish(String address, Object message, DeliveryOptions options) {
    getVertx().eventBus().publish(address, message, options);
  }

  default void publish(String address, JsonMessage message) {
    publish(address, message.json());
  }

  default void publish(String address, JsonMessage message, DeliveryOptions options) {
    publish(address, message.json(), options);
  }
}
```

The user of your trait can provide delivery options if they like. But they
aren't forced to do so because you provide a method without any options. That's
convenient, too.

### The `register` method

Repeat this procedure for the `consumer` method from the event bus instance. Add
a `register` method to your trait:

```java title="WithEventBus.java" {4-6}
public interface WithEventBus extends Verticle {
  // [...]

  default <T> void register(String address, Handler<Message<T>> handler) {
    getVertx().eventBus().consumer(address, handler);
  }
}
```

In this example, you provide convenient access to the consuming side of the
event bus and rename the method to specify better the behavior that your trait's
user expects.

To integrate the automatic conversion from receiving messages to `JsonMessage`
based messages, you need to write a functional interface that provides the
converted type to the implementing method:

```java title="MessageHandler.java"
@FunctionalInterface
public interface MessageHandler<T extends JsonMessage> {
  void handle(T body);
}
```

Now, you use that interface in the `WithEventBus` trait:

```java title="WithEventBus.java" {8-10}
public interface WithEventBus extends Verticle {
  // [...]

  default <T> void register(String address, Handler<Message<T>> handler) {
    getVertx().eventBus().consumer(address, handler);
  }

  default <V extends JsonMessage> void register(String address, MessageHandler<V> handler, Class<V> type) {
    this.<JsonObject>register(address, message -> JsonMessage.on(type, message, handler));
  }
}
```

Now, the `register` method automatically converts the incoming message to the
specified type when the user provides it.

The same step is repeatable so that the handler not only provides the converted
message body but also the message itself:

```java title="ExtendedMessageHandler.java"
@FunctionalInterface
public interface ExtendedMessageHandler<V extends JsonMessage, T> {
	void handle(V body, Message<T> message);
}
```

```java title="WithEventBus.java" {12-19}
public interface WithEventBus extends Verticle {
  // [...]

  default <T> void register(String address, Handler<Message<T>> handler) {
    getVertx().eventBus().consumer(address, handler);
  }

  default <V extends JsonMessage> void register(String address, MessageHandler<V> handler, Class<V> type) {
    this.<JsonObject>register(address, message -> JsonMessage.on(type, message, handler));
  }

  default <V extends JsonMessage, T> void register(
    String address,
    ExtendedMessageHandler<V, T> handler,
    Class<V> type) {
      this.<JsonObject>register(address,
        message -> JsonMessage.on(type, message,
          body -> handler.handle(body, message)));
    }
}
```

You can extend your trait further with many more event bus methods if you like.
However, for this example, the current functionality can reduce repetition in
the sample verticles.

### Refactoring of the sample verticles

The `WithEventBus` now simplifies the access to the event bus in verticles.
Let's update the sample verticle using your new trait:

```java title="Responder.java" {1-2,6,9-18}
public class Responder extends TelestionVerticle<GenericConfiguration>
    implements WithEventBus {

  @Override
  public void onStart() {
    register("some-address", this::handle, SpecialMessage.class);
  }

  private void handle(SpecialMessage body, Message<JsonObject> message) {
    logger.debug("Received: {}", body);

    // do some calcuation or change something
    var result = new SpecialMessage(/* [...] */);

    message.reply(result.json());
    publish("update-address", result);
  }
}
```

```java title="Repeater.java" {1-2,15}
public class Repeater extends TelestionVerticle<GenericConfiguration>
    implements WithEventBus {

  @Override
  public void onStart() {
    var delay = Duration.ofSeconds(1).toMillis();

    vertx.setInterval(delay, id -> {
      var message = new PingMessage();

      var options = new DeliveryOptions();
      var headers = options.getHeaders()
          .add("send-time", System.currentTimeInMillis());

      publish("ping-address", message, options);
    });
  }
}
```

```java title="Rerequester.java" {1-2,6,9-15}
public class Rerequester extends TelestionVerticle<GenericConfiguration>
    implements WithEventBus {

  @Override
  public void onStart() {
    register("request-address", this::handle, RequestMessage.class);
  }

  private void handle(RequestMessage request, Message<JsonObject> message) {
    // okay, we received a request message, we need another request
    var internalRequest = new InternalMessage(request);
    request("internal-address", internalRequest)
      .onSuccess(response -> message.reply(response))
      .onFailure(cause -> message.fail(500, cause.getMessage()));
  }
}
```

You can write even more traits for Verticle. For example, the timing functions or
shared data from the `vertx` context.

The Telestion API provides many more traits for verticles:
