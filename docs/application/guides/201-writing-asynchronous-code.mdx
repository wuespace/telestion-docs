=== When to use this template:
Use this template when you want to explain how to work with a specific technology/concept.

=== When not to use this template:
When
- the article provides a quick explanation of a single concept (use a concept instead)
- the article should be a quick way to look things up (use a reference instead)
- the article focuses on how to solve a particular technical problem (use a tutorial instead)

=== Guide or Tutorial
A tutorial provides a quick, technical "step-by-step" tutorial for a
given problem. Thus, a guide describes less the handling of a specific problem
and more the general interaction of the reader with a given concept.

Example with npm articles:
- "npm": (Concept, explaining what npm is)
- "Installing a dependency with npm" (Tutorial, providing a quick tutorial to
  solve a technical problem)
- "Managing dependencies with npm" (Guide, including both technical knowledge, but
  also best practices and more)

=== Writing tips:
- Write in the present tense
- Use neutral pronouns (they/them instead of he/she and him/her)
- Be respectful to everyone
- Be aware of the potential for cultural misunderstandings
- Guides are more comprehensive than many other article types.
  Feel free to add context and best practices.
- Mention common pitfalls and how not to use something (and why)

## Why writing asynchronous?

Accessing resources that aren't immediately available like reading files from the filesystem
or launching a HTTP server take some time and can block the event loop of a verticle.
This can slow down the specific verticle and in the worst case the entire application resulting
in dropped mission-critical data.

Therefore Vert.x and Telestion make usage of asynchronous code execution.

Java and Vert.x provide different mechanisms to fulfill that requirement.

Lets take a look at some of them.

## Asynchronous code structures

### Recurring events

#### Concept of anonymous and reference functions

Handlers or lambda functions are nothing more than functions
passed as arguments into other functions.

Sometimes the passed function is already defined as instance or class method inside the class
or declared "on-the-fly" like lambda functions (also called anonymous functions).

To receive functions as arguments and successfully call them, you need a functional interface.

Lets define a function that receives two operands, evaluate them and return the result:

```java title="MathFunction.java"
@FunctionalInterface
public interface MathFunction {
  int handle(int op1, int op2);
}
```

Now, use this definition to combine multiple values from e.g. an integer array:

```java title="MathReducer.java"
public class MathReducer {
  public static int reduce(int[] values, MathFunction function) {
    if (values.length < 1) return 0;
    if (values.length < 2) return values[0];

    int result = function.handle(values[0], values[1]);

    for (int i = 2; i < values.length; i++) {
      result = function.handle(result, values[i]);
    }

    return result;
  }

  public static int add(int op1, int op2) {
    return op1 + op2;
  }

  public static int multiply(int op1, int op2) {
    return op1 * op2;
  }
}
```

The `reduce` method receives the value array and a function to combine two values into one.
Additionally, there are some predefined "reducer" functions like summation or multiplication.

Lets use the reducer on a sample set of integer values:

```java title="Main.java"
public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    // your integer values you want to reduce
    var values = new int[]{ 5, 8, 2, 4, 11 };

    // use predefined functions via the '::' scope operator
    System.out.println("Sum: " + MathReducer.reduce(values, MathReducer::add)); // 30
    System.out.println("Product: " + MathReducer.reduce(values, MathReducer::multiply)); // 3520

    // or define your own specialised function handler on the fly
    // (called lambda or anonymous function)
    System.out.println("Modulo: " + MathReducer.reduce(values, (op1, op2) -> op1 % op2)); // 1
  }
}
```

In the first example the `reducer` takes the sample array and a reference to the `add` method
to summarize all values.
The second example does roughly the same with one exception that the values aren't summarized
but instead multiplied via the `multiply` method.
The last example doesn't use a predefined method at all but instead define an anonymous function
directly in the function call to calculate the residual value.

As you can see, you don't need to change the core implementation of the `reduce` method
to handle a great collection of mathematical functions. Cool, isn't it?

#### Vert.x handlers

Vert.x already provides a function definition that is used all around in the Vert.x ecosystem.

<Reference to="https://javadoc.io/static/io.vertx/vertx-core/4.2.6/io/vertx/core/Handler.html">
  Vert.x <code>Handler</code> API reference
</Reference>

For example registering a consumer on an event bus address uses this type definition:

```java title="RegisterVerticle.java"
public class RegisterVerticle extends TelestionVerticle<NoConfiguration> {
  @Override
  public void onStart() {
    vertx.eventBus().consumer("some-address", message -> {
      // I'm a lambda function of the type "Handler<Message>"
    });
  }
}
```

### One-time events

#### Futures

Futures wrap asynchronous operations and provide a unified event-driven API to hear on a result
from the wrapped operation and act accordingly.

A future has three states:

- the `Pending` state which is the _initial_ state during creation
- the `Success` state which indicates that the asynchronous operation has ended _successfully_
- the `Failure` state which indicates that the asynchronous operation has ended _with errors_

<Image
	src="/static/img/drawio-diagrams/vertx/promise-states.drawio.svg"
	invertible
  center
/>

Due to the nature of futures not completing directly you can add event handlers
to the future object that are called based on the outcome of the asynchronous operation
represented by the future:

- use the `onSuccess` handler to run further steps if the operation has ended _successfully_
- use the `onFailure` handler to run further steps if the operation has ended _with errors_
- use the `onComplete` handler if you only interested in the completion
  of the operation _regardless_ of the outcome

Take a look at the following example on requesting information via the event bus:

```java title="Requester.java"
public class Requester extends TelestionVerticle<NoConfiguration> implements WithEventBus {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    var vertx = Vertx.vertx();

    vertx.eventBus().consumer("some-address", message -> message.reply("Pong"));
    vertx.deployVerticle(new Requester());
  }

  @Override
  public void onStart() throws Exception {
    request("some-address", "Ping")
        .onSuccess(message -> logger.info("Response: {}", message.body().toString()))
        .onFailure(error -> logger.error("Cannot request infos:", error))
        .onComplete(result -> logger.debug("Request has succeeded or failed."));

    logger.debug("Request sent.");

    // 1. Request sent.
    // 2. Response: Pong
    // 3. Request has succeeded or failed.
  }
}
```

The `request` method receives the target address and a message for the responder.
Additionally it returns a future which succeeds if the response if positive
and fails if the response is negative.

Directly after the call the future is still pending.
Therefore the logger call below the request runs first.

Eventually, the future completes.
Then the future calls (depending on the result) the success or failure handler
and always the completion handler.

#### Promises

Promises are the "inner" part of futures. They control the final future state
and pass through the computed result (if there is any).

The best examples are the `onStart` and `onStop` methods of the `TelestionVerticle`.
Here the extending verticle methods receive promises the inform the "outer" world
about their final state.

This verticle starts a HTTP server that listens on port `8080`:

```java title="HttpServerVerticle.java"
public class HttpServerVerticle extends TelestionVerticle<NoConfiguration> {
  @Override
  public void onStart(Promise<Void> startPromise) throws Exception {
    server = vertx.createHttpServer();
    server.listen(8080)
        .onSuccess(server -> startPromise.complete())
        .onFailure(startPromise::fail);
  }

  @Override
  public void onStop(Promise<Void> stopPromise) throws Exception {
    server.close().onComplete(stopPromise);
  }

  private HttpServer server;
}
```

The verticle registers a success handler on the returned future from the `server.listen` method
(as described in [futures](#futures)).
This method completes the `startPromise` which in turn informs the "outer" world
about the successful startup of the entire verticle.

To capture startup failures of the HTTP server, the registered failure handler receives possible
startup errors and pass them through to the "outer" world via the `startPromise.fail` method.

To gracefully stop the server on verticle stop, use the same principle on the returned future
from the `server.close` method.
Because of equivalent types of promise and future you can directly use the `onComplete` event
to control the provided promise.
This keeps the source code short and readable.

:::tip Type Mismatch

Sometimes future and promise type don't match.
This prevents you from using the `onComplete(promise)` shorthand.
To fix this issue, you can use the `map` function on the future to change the futures return type
to the desired result before completing the promise via the shorthand call.

The `mapEmpty` function changes the futures return type to `Void` to also support void promises.

:::

#### Mapping Future Results

<Image
	src="/static/img/drawio-diagrams/vertx/future-map.drawio.svg"
	invertible
  center
/>

The `map` function has the same behavior as the `map` function of a stream.
It receives the result from the succeeded future and returns the replacement.
Use `mapEmpty` to map to a `Void` value.

The `otherwise` function has the same behavior as the `map` function but only changes
the rejected result (exceptions most of the time) if the future fails.
Use `otherwiseEmpty` to map to a `Void` value.

#### Composing Futures

<Image
	src="/static/img/drawio-diagrams/vertx/future-compose.drawio.svg"
	invertible
  center
/>

The `compose` function receives the result from the succeeded future
and should return another future that "replaces" the old one.

If the start future or the replacement future failes, following `compose` functions get skipped.

#### Recovering Futures

<Image
	src="/static/img/drawio-diagrams/vertx/future-recover.drawio.svg"
	invertible
  center
/>

The `recover` function can "recover" a future from a failure state. It receives the failure result
and should return another future that "replaces" the old one.

If the start future or the replacement future succeeds, following `recover` functions get skipped.

#### Transforming Futures

<Image
	src="/static/img/drawio-diagrams/vertx/future-transform.drawio.svg"
	invertible
  center
/>

The `transform` function receives the succeeded result or the failed result depending
on the future's final state.
It should return a new future which "replaces" the old one.

`transform` functions are called regardless of the final state of the prior future.

#### Finalizing Futures

<Image
	src="/static/img/drawio-diagrams/vertx/future-eventually.drawio.svg"
	invertible
  center
/>

The `eventually` function "blocks" the result transmission on the calling future.
The function receives the succeeded or failed result depending
on the future's final state and should return a new future.

Once the returned future succeeds or fails, the lock is raised and the calling future continues.
