The _Application_ is the backend of the Telestion ecosystem and based on Java
(or, more generally speaking, the Java Virtual Machine).

The Application processes incoming data, parses it, saves it to a database, etc.
All in all, it's the part doing the necessary Ground Station Magic to enable
Telestion to work.

Typically, Telestion projects use a mix of pre-defined and custom so-called
_Verticles_ that, together, create the full Ground Station.

The following sections teach you everything you need to know to develop for the
_Application_ within the Telestion ecosystem.
