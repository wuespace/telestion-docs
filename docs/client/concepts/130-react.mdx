Concept
=======

=== When to use this template:
Use this template when you need to describe a concept, technology,
or something similar. In other words: whenever you need to write an
article that describes a concept where the concept's name can be the
article's title (e.g., "Vert. x", "Verticle", "Event Bus")

=== When not to use this template:
Do not use these templates for articles that give context on how
to use/approach the topic. Instead, it would be best if you used a guide for that.

Writing a guide and a concept article are not mutually exclusive. Instead,
you should, in most cases, write both, where the concept gives a brief overview
of what it is, and the guide is a longer article explaining best practices on using
it.

E.g.:
Concept: Event Bus
Guide: Interacting with the Event Bus


=== Writing tips:
- Write in the present tense
- Use neutral pronouns (they/them instead of he/she and him/her)
- Be respectful to everyone
- Be aware of the potential for cultural misunderstandings

<!-- Brief Description (1-3 lines) of the concept: -->

React describes itself as _"A JavaScript library for building user interfaces"_
(https://reactjs.org/). It's one of the fundamental pieces of the Telestion
Client tech stack.

It allows you to write user interfaces by defining and re-using UI components.

## Components

Components are re-usable "building blocks" that render some UI (possibly
including other Components) based on their _Props_ and _State_.

## Props

Props are values passed down to component instances. In the example below, the
`<Counter />`'s `title` would be a prop of that component.

Components re-render automatically if one of the props passed to them changes.

## State

Components can also manage their own state, which they can update.

Components re-render automatically if their state changes.

## Example code

<!-- if applicable -->

````jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function App() {
	return (
		<>
			<Counter title="A" />
			<Counter title="B" />
		</>
	);
}

function Counter(props) {
	const [counter, setCounter] = useState(0);

	return (
		<div>
			<p>
				{props.title}: {counter}
			</p>
			<Button onClick={() => setCounter(counter + 1)}>Increase</Button>
			<Button onClick={() => setCounter(counter - 1)}>Decrease</Button>
		</div>
	);
}

function Button(props) {
	return (
		<button className="my-btn" onClick={props.onClick}>
			{props.children}
		</button>
	);
}
````
