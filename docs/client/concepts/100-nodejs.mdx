Concept
=======

=== When to use this template:
Use this template when you need to describe a concept, technology,
or something similar. In other words: whenever you need to write an
article that describes a concept where the concept's name can be the
article's title (e.g., "Vert. x", "Verticle", "Event Bus")

=== When not to use this template:
Do not use these templates for articles that give context on how
to use/approach the topic. Instead, it would be best if you used a guide for that.

Writing a guide and a concept article are not mutually exclusive. Instead,
you should, in most cases, write both, where the concept gives a brief overview
of what it is, and the guide is a longer article explaining best practices on using
it.

E.g.:
Concept: Event Bus
Guide: Interacting with the Event Bus


=== Writing tips:
- Write in the present tense
- Use neutral pronouns (they/them instead of he/she and him/her)
- Be respectful to everyone
- Be aware of the potential for cultural misunderstandings

<!-- Brief Description (1-3 lines) of the concept: -->

_NodeJS_, also called _Node.js_ or, short: _Node_, is a runtime environment for
JavaScript. You can run it from the command line using the node command.

You can use it to run applications written in JavaScript. Furthermore, it
exposes APIs that enable applications to access native features such as the file
system and much more.

## The command-line interface

To run a JS file with Node, run `node [JS file location]` in your command line.
It's also possible to open an interactive REPL (Read-eval-print loop) by just
running `node` without any arguments.

## _"Hello World"_ in Node.js

Create a file `myFile.js` with the following content:

````js title='myFile.js'
console.log('Hello World');
````

You can then run it using `node myFile.js` in your command line:

````sh
$ node myFile.js
Hello World
````
