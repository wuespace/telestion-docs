=== When to use this template:
Use this template to describe a concept, technology,
or something similar. In other words: whenever you need to write an
article that describes a concept where the concept's name can be the
article's title (e.g., "Vert. x", "Verticle", or "Event Bus")

=== When not to use this template:
Do not use these templates for articles that give context on how
to use/approach the topic. Instead, it would be best if you used a guide for that.

Writing a guide and a concept article are not mutually exclusive. Instead,
you should, in most cases, write both, where the concept gives a brief overview
of what it is, and the guide is a longer article explaining best practices on using
it.

E.g.:
Concept: Event Bus
Guide: Interacting with the Event Bus


=== Writing tips:
- Write in the present tense
- Use neutral pronouns (they/them instead of "he/she" and "him/her")
- Be respectful to everyone
- Be aware of the potential for cultural misunderstandings

<!-- Brief Description (1-3 lines) of the concept: -->

Electron is a framework for building desktop apps with web technologies. We use
it in our ecosystem to enable the distribution of the Client as a desktop
application.

## Why as a native desktop application?

While you can distribute your Client to a web server so that your users can
access it with a web browser (and often, this is also very useful), distributing
as a desktop application allows you to have a much more specific environment
(like Chromium in a specific version), which makes it easier to develop.

Furthermore, distribution as a desktop app allows you to add native
functionality (e.g., desktop notifications) to your Client without much effort.
