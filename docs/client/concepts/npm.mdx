Concept
=======

=== When to use this template:
Use this template when you need to describe a concept, technology,
or something similar. In other words: whenever you need to write an
article that describes a concept where the concept's name can be the
article's title (e.g., "Vert. x", "Verticle", "Event Bus")

=== When not to use this template:
Do not use these templates for articles that give context on how
to use/approach the topic. Instead, it would be best if you used a guide for that.

Writing a guide and a concept article are not mutually exclusive. Instead,
you should, in most cases, write both, where the concept gives a brief overview
of what it is, and the guide is a longer article explaining best practices on using
it.

E.g.:
Concept: Event Bus
Guide: Interacting with the Event Bus


=== Writing tips:
- Write in the present tense
- Use neutral pronouns (they/them instead of he/she and him/her)
- Be respectful to everyone
- Be aware of the potential for cultural misunderstandings

<!-- Brief Description (1-3 lines) of the concept: -->

`npm` is a package manager for applications written in JavaScript (often running
on NodeJS) Similar to PIP for Python world or composer for PHP, npm is a package
manager for JavaScript, allowing installation and management of the project's
dependencies (such as libraries, build tools, and more).

## `package.json`

`npm` uses a file called `package.json` to keep track of the required
dependencies. Dependencies will, themselves, have a `package.json` that can also
list dependencies. Installing dependencies using the `npm install` command
automatically resolves and installs these recursive dependencies.

## `package-lock.json`

The `package-lock.json` file gets generated when running `npm install` and notes
the exact dependency versions you've installed. Later, by running `npm ci`,
these exact versions can be re-installed, allowing for a consistent working
environment.

## `node_modules`

`npm` installs the project dependencies in the `node_modules` directory. As this
will, after installation, often contain many files that can get re-installed, we
recommend to include the folder in your .gitignore file
