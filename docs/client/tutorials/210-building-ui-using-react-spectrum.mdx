Tutorial
========

=== When to use this template:
Use this template when you want to give a quick, step-by-step tutorial for solving a specific
technical problem. Tutorials allow the reader to learn how to implement something within
their projects quickly.

=== When not to use this template:
When your article focuses more on a concept/technology and is not rooted in a specific technical
problem ("how to do XY?"), consider using a guide instead.

=== Guide or Tutorial
A tutorial provides a quick, technical "step-by-step" tutorial for a
given problem. Thus, a guide describes less the handling of a specific problem
and more the general interaction of the reader with a given concept.

Example with npm articles:
- "npm": (Concept, explaining what npm is)
- "Installing a dependency with npm" (Tutorial, providing a quick tutorial to
  solve a technical problem)
- "Managing dependencies with npm" (Guide, including both technical knowledge, but
  also best practices and more)

=== Writing tips:
- Write in the present tense
- Use neutral pronouns (they/them instead of he/she and him/her)
- Be respectful to everyone
- Be aware of the potential for cultural misunderstandings
- Provide explanations for what you do, but focus on the step-by-step guide
  without deeply explaining every technical decision and why it's best prcatice
  to do so (you can describe best practices in a guide, a tutorial must focus on
  keeping the "step by step" flow going)

<!-- Short description of what the article covers: -->

In this tutorial, you'll use the React Spectrum library to build your widget's
UI. React Spectrum is a React-based implementation of Adobe's Spectrum Design
system. Spectrum Design is the design system used by
`@wuespace/telestion-client-common` library and integrates well into the other
parts of the client's UI.

:::info Prerequisites

To complete this tutorial, you should be familiar with React, TypeScript, and
have a widget bootstrapped according to the
[Bootstrapping a widget tutorial](../bootstrapping-a-widget).

:::

## What you'll build

You'll build your widget's UI. It should display the connection status
(Connected / Disconnected) of three different I/O interfaces: `SAT A`, `SAT B`,
and `SAT C` and have "Reset" buttons that could, for example, trigger a
Telecommand:

<Image src="img/client/my-first-widget/04.png" center />

In this tutorial, you won't connect this to any actual data source (the event
bus) that's a part of the following tutorial.

The code you'll write looks like this:

```ts title='src/widgets/my-new-widget/widget.tsx'
import {
	Divider,
	Flex,
	Heading,
	StatusLight,
	View,
	ActionButton
} from '@adobe/react-spectrum';

export function Widget() {
	return (
		<View padding={'size-200'} height={'100%'}>
			<Flex direction="column" width="100%">
				<Heading level={3}>Connection Status</Heading>
				<Divider size="M" marginBottom={'size-200'} />
				<Indicator system="SAT A" />
				<Indicator system="SAT B" />
				<Indicator system="SAT C" />
			</Flex>
		</View>
	);
}

function Indicator(props: { system: string }) {
	return (
		<Flex alignItems={'baseline'} gap={'size-200'}>
			<StatusLight variant="positive">{props.system} Connected</StatusLight>
			<ActionButton>Reset</ActionButton>
		</Flex>
	);
}
```

## Step 1: Build the overall layout

Adjust the `widget.tsx` to have a base layout for our widget's UI:

```ts title='src/widgets/my-new-widget/widget.tsx'
// highlight-start
import { Divider, Flex, Heading, View } from '@adobe/react-spectrum';
// highlight-end

export function Widget() {
	// highlight-start
	return (
		<View padding={'size-200'} height={'100%'}>
			<Flex direction="column" width="100%">
				<Heading level={3}>Connection Status</Heading>
				<Divider size="M" marginBottom={'size-200'} />
				{/* Content goes here */}
			</Flex>
		</View>
	);
	// highlight-end
}
```

The result should look something like this:

<Image src="img/client/my-first-widget/03.png" center />

## Step 2: Add component for a system's indicator

Since you have three different systems, you'll extract their connection status
UI into one reusable `<Indicator />` component and use it for your three
different systems:

```java title='Car.java'
import {
	Divider,
	Flex,
	Heading,
  // highlight-next-line
	StatusLight,
	View,
  // highlight-next-line
	ActionButton
} from '@adobe/react-spectrum';

export function Widget() {
	return (
		<View padding={'size-200'} height={'100%'}>
			<Flex direction="column" width="100%">
				<Heading level={3}>Connection Status</Heading>
				<Divider size="M" marginBottom={'size-200'} />
				// highlight-start
				<Indicator system="SAT A" />
				<Indicator system="SAT B" />
				<Indicator system="SAT C" />
				// highlight-end
			</Flex>
		</View>
	);
}

// highlight-start
function Indicator(props: { system: string }) {
	return (
		<Flex alignItems={'baseline'} gap={'size-200'}>
			<StatusLight variant="positive">{props.system} Connected</StatusLight>
			<ActionButton>Reset</ActionButton>
		</Flex>
	);
}
// highlight-end
```

Now, our UI has status-light indicators for the connection status of the three
different systems and reset buttons:

<Image src="img/client/my-first-widget/04.png" center />

## Next steps

<!-- Short concluding sentence: -->

You have now developed a realistic widget using the Spectrum Design system.

You should familiarize yourself with both the Spectrum Design system in general
as well as the React Spectrum implementation using Adobe's resources:

<Reference to="https://spectrum.adobe.com/">
	Adobe Spectrum Design System
</Reference>
<Reference to="https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-spectrum/index.html">
	React Spectrum Documentation
</Reference>

Of course, this widget, right now, doesn't reflect the actual connection status.
To change that, you'll learn how to connect this widget to the Application's
event bus using the APIs from `@wuespace/telestion-client-core` in the next
tutorial:
