Tutorial
========

=== When to use this template:
Use this template when you want to give a quick, step-by-step tutorial for solving a specific
technical problem. Tutorials allow the reader to learn how to implement something within
their projects quickly.

=== When not to use this template:
When your article focuses more on a concept/technology and is not rooted in a specific technical
problem ("how to do XY?"), consider using a guide instead.

=== Guide or Tutorial
A tutorial provides a quick, technical "step-by-step" tutorial for a
given problem. Thus, a guide describes less the handling of a specific problem
and more the general interaction of the reader with a given concept.

Example with npm articles:
- "npm": (Concept, explaining what npm is)
- "Installing a dependency with npm" (Tutorial, providing a quick tutorial to
  solve a technical problem)
- "Managing dependencies with npm" (Guide, including both technical knowledge, but
  also best practices and more)

=== Writing tips:
- Write in the present tense
- Use neutral pronouns (they/them instead of he/she and him/her)
- Be respectful to everyone
- Be aware of the potential for cultural misunderstandings
- Provide explanations for what you do, but focus on the step-by-step guide
  without deeply explaining every technical decision and why it's best prcatice
  to do so (you can describe best practices in a guide, a tutorial must focus on
  keeping the "step by step" flow going)

<!-- Short description of what the article covers: -->

In this tutorial, we install the telstion-client-cli and generate a new telestion-client project.

:::info Prerequisites

To complete this tutorial, you should be familiar with basic terminal commands.

:::

## What we'll build

The result is a project structure that you can immediately begin to customize.

## Step 1: Installing `tc-cli`

Install the `tc-cli` by running the following command in your terminal:

```sh
npm install --global @wuespace/telestion-client-cli
```

This installs the CLI, which you can call using the `tc-cli` command.

## Step 2: Initializing the project

This step initializes the project.

Open the terminal where you want to generate the project and run

```sh
tc-cli init myproject
```

Replace `myproject` with your own foulder name.

This generates a folder that contains a ready-to-use client project and installs all necessary dependencies.

:::info Windows execution policies

On Windows machines, you might get an error message that is about execution policies.
In this case, run the power shell as administrator and use this command:

```sh
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```

Restart your other terminal and re-run the `tc-cli` command.

:::

## Step 3: Run the client

Run the client by navigating into your folder and run

```sh
npm start
```

:::tip 

This runs `tc-cli start --electron` in the background.

:::

An electron window opens and you can see your application.

## Next steps

<!-- Short concluding sentence: -->

Now that we've generated our client project, we'll configure and extend our client in the following tutorials.
