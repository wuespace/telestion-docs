Tutorial
========

=== When to use this template:
Use this template when you want to give a quick, step-by-step tutorial for solving a specific
technical problem. Tutorials allow the reader to learn how to implement something within
their projects quickly.

=== When not to use this template:
When your article focuses more on a concept/technology and is not rooted in a specific technical
problem ("how to do XY?"), consider using a guide instead.

=== Guide or Tutorial
A tutorial provides a quick, technical "step-by-step" tutorial for a
given problem. Thus, a guide describes less the handling of a specific problem
and more the general interaction of the reader with a given concept.

Example with npm articles:
- "npm": (Concept, explaining what npm is)
- "Installing a dependency with npm" (Tutorial, providing a quick tutorial to
  solve a technical problem)
- "Managing dependencies with npm" (Guide, including both technical knowledge, but
  also best practices and more)

=== Writing tips:
- Write in the present tense
- Use neutral pronouns (they/them instead of he/she and him/her)
- Be respectful to everyone
- Be aware of the potential for cultural misunderstandings
- Provide explanations for what you do, but focus on the step-by-step guide
  without deeply explaining every technical decision and why it's best prcatice
  to do so (you can describe best practices in a guide, a tutorial must focus on
  keeping the "step by step" flow going)

<!-- Short description of what the article covers: -->

In this tutorial, you install the telstion-client-cli and generate a new
telestion-client project.

:::info Prerequisites

To complete this tutorial, you should be familiar with basic terminal commands.

:::

## What you'll build

The result is a project structure that you can begin to customize.

## Step 1: Installing `tc-cli`

Install the `tc-cli` by running the following command in your terminal:

```sh
npm install --global @wuespace/telestion-client-cli
```

This command installs the CLI, which you can call using the `tc-cli` command.

## Step 2: Initializing the project

This step initializes the project.

Open the terminal where you want to generate the project and run

```sh
tc-cli init myproject
```

Replace `myproject` with your own desired name.

:::tip Using the `telestion-project-template`

When using the
[`telestion-project-template` repository](https://github.com/wuespace/telestion-project-template)
for your project, just run `tc-cli init` (without a folder name) inside the
repo's root folder. This command, then, automatically bootstraps a client
project into the repo's `client` folder.

:::

This command generates a folder with the chosen name that contains a
ready-to-use client project and installs all necessary dependencies.

:::info Windows execution policies

On Windows machines, you might get an error message about execution policies. In
this case, run the power shell as administrator and use this command:

```sh
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```

Restart your other terminal and re-run the `tc-cli` command.

:::

## Step 3: Run the client

Run the client by navigating into your folder and run

```sh
npm start
```

:::tip

This runs `tc-cli start --electron` in the background.

:::

An electron window opens, and you can see your application.

## Next steps

<!-- Short concluding sentence: -->

Now that you've generated your client project, you can configure and extend your
client in the following tutorials.
