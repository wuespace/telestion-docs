Tutorial
========

=== When to use this template:
Use this template when you want to give a quick, step-by-step tutorial for solving a specific
technical problem. Tutorials allow the reader to learn how to implement something within
their projects quickly.

=== When not to use this template:
When your article focuses more on a concept/technology and is not rooted in a specific technical
problem ("how to do XY?"), consider using a guide instead.

=== Guide or Tutorial
A tutorial provides a quick, technical "step-by-step" tutorial for a
given problem. Thus, a guide describes less the handling of a specific problem
and more the general interaction of the reader with a given concept.

Example with npm articles:
- "npm": (Concept, explaining what npm is)
- "Installing a dependency with npm" (Tutorial, providing a quick tutorial to
  solve a technical problem)
- "Managing dependencies with npm" (Guide, including both technical knowledge, but
  also best practices and more)

=== Writing tips:
- Write in the present tense
- Use neutral pronouns (they/them instead of he/she and him/her)
- Be respectful to everyone
- Be aware of the potential for cultural misunderstandings
- Provide explanations for what you do, but focus on the step-by-step guide
  without deeply explaining every technical decision and why it's best prcatice
  to do so (you can describe best practices in a guide, a tutorial must focus on
  keeping the "step by step" flow going)

<!-- Short description of what the article covers: -->

In this tutorial, you'll extend your widget from the
[Building UI using React Spectrum tutorial](../building-ui-using-react-spectrum)
to show some actual data and be able to send commands when pressing the "Reset"
button.

:::info Prerequisites

To complete this tutorial, you should be familiar with React hooks, NodeJS, and
the concept of the Event Bus. You should also have access to the code from the
[Building UI using React Spectrum tutorial](../building-ui-using-react-spectrum)
as you'll extend the widget from that tutorial.

:::

## What you'll build

You'll use the Event Bus bridge and its APIs from the
`@wuespace/telestion-client-core` package to interact with the Event Bus
directly from your widget. You'll also build a mock server so that you can test
your widget without the overhead of running the entire (Java-based) Application
layer.

First, you'll add a mock Application server. Then, you'll use the
`useChannelLatest()` hook to display actual data. Lastly, you'll send an Event
Bus message when an operator presses the "Reset" button.

In the end, you'll have written the following code:

````ts title=src/plugins/mock-server.ts
import {
	CallbackId,
	MockServer,
	OnClose,
	OnInit
} from '@wuespace/vertx-mock-server';

class MyMockServer extends MockServer implements OnInit, OnClose {
	private resetListener: CallbackId = 0;
	private systemStatusIntervalId: any;

	onInit() {
		const systems = ['SAT A', 'SAT B', 'SAT C'];

		this.resetListener = this.register('reset', raw => {
			console.log('Received reset request:', raw.message);
		});

		this.systemStatusIntervalId = setInterval(() => {
			systems.forEach(system => {
				this.send(`system-status/${system}`, Math.random() > 0.5);
			});
		}, 2000);
	}

	onClose() {
		this.unregister(this.resetListener);
		clearInterval(this.systemStatusIntervalId);
	}
}

const mockServer = new MyMockServer();

export function onReady() {
	console.log('Starting mock Application Server');
	mockServer.listen();
}
````

````js title=telestion.config.js
const path = require('path');

module.exports = {
	plugins: [path.join(__dirname, 'src', 'plugins', 'mock-server.ts')]
};
````

````tsx title=src/widgets/my-new-widget/widget.tsx
import {
	useBroadcast,
	useChannelLatest
} from '@wuespace/telestion-client-core';

// [...]

function Indicator(props: { system: string }) {
	const broadcast = useBroadcast('reset');
	const status = useChannelLatest(`system-status/${props.system}`) ?? false;

	return (
		<Flex alignItems={'baseline'} gap={'size-200'}>
			<StatusLight variant={status ? 'positive' : 'negative'}>
				{props.system} {status ? 'Connected' : 'Disconnected'}
			</StatusLight>
			<ActionButton onPress={() => broadcast({ system: props.system })}>
				Reset
			</ActionButton>
		</Flex>
	);
}
````

## Step 1: Add an event bus mock server for local testing

Install the `@wuespace/vertx-mock-server` package by running the following
terminal in your client project folder:

````sh
npm i -D @wuespace/vertx-mock-server
````

Add a file for your new plugin called `src/plugins/mock-server.ts` with the
following code:

````ts title=src/plugins/mock-server.ts
import {
	CallbackId,
	MockServer,
	OnClose,
	OnInit
} from '@wuespace/vertx-mock-server';

class MyMockServer extends MockServer implements OnInit, OnClose {
	private resetListener: CallbackId = 0;
	private systemStatusIntervalId: any;

	onInit() {
		const systems = ['SAT A', 'SAT B', 'SAT C'];

		this.resetListener = this.register('reset', raw => {
			console.log('Received reset request:', raw.message);
		});

		this.systemStatusIntervalId = setInterval(() => {
			systems.forEach(system => {
				this.send(`system-status/${system}`, Math.random() > 0.5);
			});
		}, 2000);
	}

	onClose() {
		this.unregister(this.resetListener);
		clearInterval(this.systemStatusIntervalId);
	}
}

const mockServer = new MyMockServer();

export function onReady() {
	console.log('Starting mock Application Server');
	mockServer.listen();
}
````

This code creates a plugin that gets called in the Electron thread once the
Electron thread gets started (when running `npm start`). It creates a mock
server which does two things:

1. it registers a listener on the `reset` channel address and logs messages to
   that channel to the console (for your reset buttons)
2. every two seconds, send a connected status (`boolean`) to the channel address
   `system-status/[system]` for your three systems

To load the plugin, you need to do one last step: in the client's root folder,
there is a `telestion.config.js` that exports an empty object right now. Adjust
it to include a list of plugins with your new plugin:

````js title=telestion.config.js
const path = require('path');

module.exports = {
	plugins: [path.join(__dirname, 'src', 'plugins', 'mock-server.ts')]
};
````

When you now restart the `npm start` command (that is, re-run
`tc-cli start --electron`), you can see the message
`Starting Mock Application Server` in the terminal.

:::tip

When making changes to the `telestion.config.js` file or any file referenced by
it (for example, plugins), you need to restart the `tc-cli start` command (or
`npm start`) to use your changes.

:::

After logging in as `admin` into `http://localhost:9870/bridge` (with an
arbitrary password) in your Electron application, after a couple of seconds, you
should see the connection status indicator in the navigation bar turning green
and saying "Connected."

## Step 2: Connect the widget's connection status indicators to the event bus

Now that you have a mock server publishing your system status every two seconds,
you need to connect your widget to that data. Thankfully, this isn't too
difficult with the help of the `useChannelLatest` hook exported by the
`@wuespace/telestion-client-core` package.

The `useChannelLatest()` hook listens to messages on a specific channel address
and always returns the latest status from there.

Adjust the `<Indicator />` functional component to use the hook to listen to the
system status on the system's system status channel and wire up your UI to use
the new status:

````tsx title=src/widgets/my-new-widget/widget.tsx
// [...]
// highlight-start
import { useChannelLatest } from '@wuespace/telestion-client-core';
// highlight-end

// [...]

function Indicator(props: { system: string }) {
	// highlight-next-line
	const status = useChannelLatest(`system-status/${props.system}`) ?? false;

	return (
		<Flex alignItems={'baseline'} gap={'size-200'}>
			// highlight-start
			<StatusLight variant={status ? 'positive' : 'negative'}>
				{props.system} {status ? 'Connected' : 'Disconnected'}
			</StatusLight>
			// highlight-end
			<ActionButton>Reset</ActionButton>
		</Flex>
	);
}
````

Take note of the `?? false`. This defaults the value to `false` in case it's
`undefined`. The default value is for when the widget hasn't received a system
status yet (which happens when initially loading the widget).

After saving the file and reloading the client, you can see the status
indicators change randomly every two seconds:

<Image src="img/client/my-first-widget/05.png" center />

## Step 3: Wiring up the "Reset" button

To make the "Reset" button broadcast a message to the `reset` channel (that
you're listening for in your mock server) when pressed, you can use the
`useBroadcast()` hook from the `@wuespace/telestion-client-core` package.

Like before, you can do this directly in your `<Indicator />` component. The
`useBroadcast()` hook takes the channel address as its first argument and
returns a function to broadcast a message to that address.

Define a function `broadcast` that publishes to your `reset` channel. Use the
Reset button's `onPress` event to call that function to broadcast a message to
that channel. Pass an object containing details about the system into the
message:

````tsx title=src/widgets/my-new-widget/widget.tsx
// [...]
import {
	// highlight-next-line
	useBroadcast,
	useChannelLatest
} from '@wuespace/telestion-client-core';

// [...]

function Indicator(props: { system: string }) {
	// highlight-next-line
	const broadcast = useBroadcast('reset');
	const status = useChannelLatest(`system-status/${props.system}`) ?? false;

	return (
		<Flex alignItems={'baseline'} gap={'size-200'}>
			<StatusLight variant={status ? 'positive' : 'negative'}>
				{props.system} {status ? 'Connected' : 'Disconnected'}
			</StatusLight>
			// highlight-start
			<ActionButton onPress={() => broadcast({ system: props.system })}>
				Reset
			</ActionButton>
			// highlight-end
		</Flex>
	);
}
````

When you reload your client application and press the reset buttons, you can see
corresponding output in the terminal where you ran `npm start`:

````text
Received reset request: { system: 'SAT C' }
Received reset request: { system: 'SAT B' }
Received reset request: { system: 'SAT A' }
Received reset request: { system: 'SAT B' }
Received reset request: { system: 'SAT C' }
````

## Next steps

<!-- Short concluding sentence: -->

Congratulations, your widget is now fully wired up to the Event Bus. It's now up
to the backend developers to create Verticles that connect the actual mission
I/O interfaces to these Event Bus messages :wink:.

But even more, you're now capable of wiring up any system to the event bus,
meaning you can build any widget, you need using plain React for the UI and the
APIs to connect to the event bus.

In the following tutorial, you'll learn how you can add configuration options to
your widget to allow Ground Station operators (that is, your users) to
re-configure your widget's behavior on the fly.

You should also familiarize yourself with the API Reference for the
`@wuespace/vertx-mock-server` package to build more complex mock servers as well
as the API Reference for the various Event Bus hooks in the
`@wuespace/telestion-client-core` package:
