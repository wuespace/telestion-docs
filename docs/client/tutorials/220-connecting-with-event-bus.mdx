Tutorial
========

=== When to use this template:
Use this template when you want to give a quick, step-by-step tutorial for solving a specific
technical problem. Tutorials allow the reader to learn how to implement something within
their projects quickly.

=== When not to use this template:
When your article focuses more on a concept/technology and is not rooted in a specific technical
problem ("how to do XY?"), consider using a guide instead.

=== Guide or Tutorial
A tutorial provides a quick, technical "step-by-step" tutorial for a
given problem. Thus, a guide describes less the handling of a specific problem
and more the general interaction of the reader with a given concept.

Example with npm articles:
- "npm": (Concept, explaining what npm is)
- "Installing a dependency with npm" (Tutorial, providing a quick tutorial to
  solve a technical problem)
- "Managing dependencies with npm" (Guide, including both technical knowledge, but
  also best practices and more)

=== Writing tips:
- Write in the present tense
- Use neutral pronouns (they/them instead of he/she and him/her)
- Be respectful to everyone
- Be aware of the potential for cultural misunderstandings
- Provide explanations for what you do, but focus on the step-by-step guide
  without deeply explaining every technical decision and why it's best prcatice
  to do so (you can describe best practices in a guide, a tutorial must focus on
  keeping the "step by step" flow going)

<!-- Short description of what the article covers: -->

In this tutorial, we'll extend our widget from the
[Building UI using React Spectrum tutorial](../building-ui-using-react-spectrum)
to show some actual data and be able to send commands when pressing the "Reset"
button.

:::info Prerequisites

To complete this tutorial, you should be familiar with React hooks, NodeJS, and
the concept of the Event Bus. You should also have access to the code from the
[Building UI using React Spectrum tutorial](../building-ui-using-react-spectrum)
as we'll extend the widget from that tutorial.

:::

## What we'll build

We'll use the Event Bus bridge and its APIs from the
`@wuespace/telestion-client-core` package to interact with the Event Bus
directly from our widget. Additionally, we'll build a mock server so that we can
test our widget without the overhead of running the entire (Java-based)
Application layer.

First, we'll add a mock Application server. Then, we'll use the
`useChannelLatest()` hook to display actual data. Last, but not least, we'll
send an Event Bus message when an operator presses the "Reset" button.

In the end, you'll have written the following code:

```ts title=src/plugins/mock-server.ts
import {
	CallbackId,
	MockServer,
	OnClose,
	OnInit
} from '@wuespace/vertx-mock-server';

class MyMockServer extends MockServer implements OnInit, OnClose {
	private resetListener: CallbackId = 0;
	private systemStatusIntervalId: any;

	onInit() {
		const systems = ['SAT A', 'SAT B', 'SAT C'];

		this.resetListener = this.register('reset', raw => {
			console.log('Received reset request:', raw.message);
		});

		this.systemStatusIntervalId = setInterval(() => {
			systems.forEach(system => {
				this.send(`system-status/${system}`, Math.random() > 0.5);
			});
		}, 2000);
	}

	onClose() {
		this.unregister(this.resetListener);
	}
}

const mockServer = new MyMockServer();

export function onReady() {
	console.log('Starting mock Application Server');
	mockServer.listen();
}
```

```ts title=telestion.config.js
const path = require('path');

module.exports = {
	plugins: [path.join(__dirname, 'src', 'plugins', 'mock-server.ts')]
};
```

```ts title=src/widgets/my-new-widget/widget.tsx
import {
	useBroadcast,
	useChannelLatest
} from '@wuespace/telestion-client-core';

// [...]

function Indicator(props: { system: string }) {
	const broadcast = useBroadcast('reset');
	const status = useChannelLatest(`system-status/${props.system}`) ?? false;

	return (
		<Flex alignItems={'baseline'} gap={'size-200'}>
			<StatusLight variant={status ? 'positive' : 'negative'}>
				{props.system} {status ? 'Connected' : 'Disconnected'}
			</StatusLight>
			<ActionButton onPress={() => broadcast({ system: props.system })}>
				Reset
			</ActionButton>
		</Flex>
	);
}
```

## Step 1: Add an event bus mock server for local testing

Install the `@wuespace/vertx-mock-server` package by running the following
terminal in your client project folder:

```sh
npm i -D @wuespace/vertx-mock-server
```

Add a file for our new plugin called `src/plugins/mock-server.ts` with the
following code:

```ts title=src/plugins/mock-server.ts
import {
	CallbackId,
	MockServer,
	OnClose,
	OnInit
} from '@wuespace/vertx-mock-server';

class MyMockServer extends MockServer implements OnInit, OnClose {
	private resetListener: CallbackId = 0;
	private systemStatusIntervalId: any;

	onInit() {
		const systems = ['SAT A', 'SAT B', 'SAT C'];

		this.resetListener = this.register('reset', raw => {
			console.log('Received reset request:', raw.message);
		});

		this.systemStatusIntervalId = setInterval(() => {
			systems.forEach(system => {
				this.send(`system-status/${system}`, Math.random() > 0.5);
			});
		}, 2000);
	}

	onClose() {
		this.unregister(this.resetListener);
	}
}

const mockServer = new MyMockServer();

export function onReady() {
	console.log('Starting mock Application Server');
	mockServer.listen();
}
```

This creates a plugin that gets called in the Electron thread once the Electron
thread gets started (when running `npm start`). It creates a mock server which
does two things:

1. it registers a listener on the `reset` channel address and logs messages to
   that channel to the console (for our reset buttons)
2. in an interval of two seconds, send a connected status (`boolean`) to the
   channel address `system-status/[system]` for our three systems

To load the plugin, you need to do one last step: In the client's root folder,
there is a `telestion.config.js` that currently exports an empty object. Adjust
it to include a list of plugins with our new plugin:

```js title=telestion.config.js
const path = require('path');

module.exports = {
	plugins: [path.join(__dirname, 'src', 'plugins', 'mock-server.ts')]
};
```

When you now re-start the `npm start` command (i.e., re-run
`tc-cli start --electron`), you can see the message
`Starting Mock Application Server` in the terminal.

:::tip

When making changes to the `telestion.config.js` file or any file referenced by
it (e.g., plugins), you need to completely restart the `tc-cli start` command
(or `npm start`) to use your changes.

:::

After logging in as `admin` into `http://localhost:9870/bridge` (with an
arbitrary password) in your Electron application, after a few seconds, you
should see the connection status indicator in the navbar turning green and
saying "Connected".

## Step 2: Connect the widget's connection status indicators to the event bus

Now that we have a mock server publishing our system status every two seconds,
we need to connect our widget to that data. Thankfully, this isn't too difficult
with the help of the `useChannelLatest` hook exported by the
`@wuespace/telestion-client-core` package.

The `useChannelLatest()` hook listens to messages on a specific channel adress
and always returns the latest status from there.

Adjust the `<Indicator />` functional component to use the hook to listen to the
system status on the system's system status channel and wire up our UI to use
the new status:

```ts title=src/widgets/my-new-widget/widget.tsx
// [...]
// highlight-start
import { useChannelLatest } from '@wuespace/telestion-client-core';
// highlight-end

// [...]

function Indicator(props: { system: string }) {
	// highlight-next-line
	const status = useChannelLatest(`system-status/${props.system}`) ?? false;

	return (
		<Flex alignItems={'baseline'} gap={'size-200'}>
			// highlight-start
			<StatusLight variant={status ? 'positive' : 'negative'}>
				{props.system} {status ? 'Connected' : 'Disconnected'}
			</StatusLight>
			// highlight-end
			<ActionButton>Reset</ActionButton>
		</Flex>
	);
}
```

Note that we default this value to `false` using `?? false`. This is for when we
haven't received a system status, yet (which happens when initially loading the
widget).

After saving the file and reloading the client, you can see the status
indicators change randomly every two seconds:

<Image src="img/client/my-first-widget/05.png" center />

## Step 3: Wiring up the "Reset" button

To make the "Reset" button broadcast a message to the `reset` channel (that
we're listening for in our mock server) when pressed, you can use the
`useBroadcast()` hook from the `@wuespace/telestion-client-core` package.

Like before, we can just do this directly in our `<Indicator />` component. The
`useBroadcast()` hook takes the channel address as its first argument and
returns a function to broadcast a message to that address.

In this case, we define a function `broadcast` that publishes to our `reset`
channel. Then, we can just use the Reset button's `onPress` event to call that
function to broadcast a message to that channel. Here, we'll pass an object
containing details about the system into the message:

```ts title=src/widgets/my-new-widget/widget.tsx
// [...]
import {
	// highlight-next-line
	useBroadcast,
	useChannelLatest
} from '@wuespace/telestion-client-core';

// [...]

function Indicator(props: { system: string }) {
	// highlight-next-line
	const broadcast = useBroadcast('reset');
	const status = useChannelLatest(`system-status/${props.system}`) ?? false;

	return (
		<Flex alignItems={'baseline'} gap={'size-200'}>
			<StatusLight variant={status ? 'positive' : 'negative'}>
				{props.system} {status ? 'Connected' : 'Disconnected'}
			</StatusLight>
			// highlight-start
			<ActionButton onPress={() => broadcast({ system: props.system })}>
				Reset
			</ActionButton>
			// highlight-end
		</Flex>
	);
}
```

When you reload your client application and press the reset buttons, you can see
corresponding output in the terminal where you ran `npm start`:

```text
Received reset request: { system: 'SAT C' }
Received reset request: { system: 'SAT B' }
Received reset request: { system: 'SAT A' }
Received reset request: { system: 'SAT B' }
Received reset request: { system: 'SAT C' }
```

## Next steps

<!-- Short concluding sentence: -->

Congratulations, your widget is now fully wired up to the Event Bus. It's now up
to the backend developers to implement Verticles that connect the actual mission
I/O interfaces to these Event Bus messages :wink:.

But even more, you're now capable of wiring up any system to the event bus,
meaning you can build any widget you need using plain React for the UI and the
APIs to connect to the event bus.

In the next tutorial, we'll take a look at adding configuration options to your
widget to allow Ground Station operators (i.e., your users) to re-configure your
widget's behaviour on the fly.

We also encourage you to check out the API Reference for the
`@wuespace/vertx-mock-server` package to implement more complex mock servers as
well as the API Reference for the various Event Bus hooks in the
`@wuespace/telestion-client-core` package:
