Welcome to the Telestion Documentation pages!

Telestion is an extensible, open-source ecosystem for building Ground Station
Software. It is based on Java for the backend and React on the frontend side.

:::info Intended for developers

Telestion is, first and foremost, an ecosystem for building mission-specific
Ground Station Software. Since every mission's requirements are different, this
documentation can only describe the general concepts and how to use the
ecosystem to develop mission-specific software.

For end-user instructions for a Telestion-based Ground Station software, please
ask your Ground Station Software Development Team!

## Telestion Concepts YouTube Series

Before you get started with developing within the Telestion Ecosystem, it's
important to grasp the various bits and pieces in the ecosystem.

We recommend watching our _Telestion Concepts_ YouTube playlist, a set of short
videos explaining the most important concepts you need to know to dive into
developing a Ground Station using Telestion:

## High-level ecosystem overview

To give you an idea of where to might go next (if you haven't watched the
YouTube playlist), let's take a quick look at the two main components of every
Telestion Project: The _Application_ and the _Client_.

The _Application_ is a Java-based software (using the Vert.x framework)
responsible for all the backend work within a Telestion project. It communicates
with the various mission I/O devices, processes the data (e.g., saving telemetry
to the database), and communicates with the client.

The _Client_ is the User Inteface your Ground Station operators interact with.
It's based on web technologies (with React and TypeScript at the core of its
tech stack) and provides a framework for building re-usable widgets that are
displayed in multiple dashboards.
