Telestion is an extensible, open source ecosystem for building Ground Station
Software. It's based on Java for the backend and React on the frontend side.

:::info Intended for developers

Telestion is an ecosystem for building mission-specific Ground Station Software.
Since every mission's requirements are different, this documentation describes
the general concepts and how to use the ecosystem to develop mission-specific
software.

For end-user instructions for a Telestion-based Ground Station software, please
ask your Ground Station Software Development Team.

## Telestion Concepts YouTube Series

Before you get started with developing within the Telestion Ecosystem, it's
important to grasp the various bits and pieces in the ecosystem.

To start, you should watch the _Telestion Concepts_ YouTube playlist, a set of
short videos explaining the most important concepts you need to know to dive
into developing a Ground Station using Telestion:

## High-level ecosystem overview

To give you an idea of where to might go next (if you haven't watched the
YouTube playlist), take a quick look at the two main components of every
Telestion Project: the _Application_ and the _Client_.

The _Application_ is a Java-based software (using the Vert.x framework)
responsible for all the backend work within a Telestion project. It communicates
with the various mission I/O devices, processes the data (for example, saving
telemetry to the database), and communicates with the Client.

The _Client_ is the User Interface your Ground Station operators interact with.
It's based on web technologies (with React and TypeScript at the core of its
tech stack) and provides a framework for building re-usable widgets that get
displayed in dashboards.
