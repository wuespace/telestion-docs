:::warning Deprecated: Vert.x-based Telestion

Please note that the application and development of backend services using
Vert.x in Telestion are deprecated. In the future, Telestion backend services
will be developed using TypeScript and Deno, or through custom integrations with
other languages.

While there may be a compatibility layer for Vert.x services in the future, its
availability is not guaranteed.

For developing backend services, please refer to the (Work-in-Progress)
documentation available here:
[https://pklaschka.github.io/telestion-docs-new/](https://pklaschka.github.io/telestion-docs-new/).
Once the documentation is complete, it will be moved to the main Telestion
documentation.

Additional Information:

- NATS will be used as the distributed message bus/message broker for Telestion.
- NATS' integrated authentication and authorization features will handle
  authentication and authorization for Ground Station operators, providing a
  single source of truth.
- The event bus bridge will no longer be featured, and clients will be directly
  connected to the NATS server.

To establish a more technology-independent terminology, the Telestion project
will modify the naming conventions as follows:

- The NATS server will be referred to as the message broker, message bus, or
  NATS server interchangeably.
- Components that act as services without an attached user interface, will be
  referred to as services or backend services collectively.
- Components that provide a user interface, formerly known as "clients," will be
  referred to as frontends. In most cases, the frontend will authenticate to the
  message broker as the user, while backend services will act on their own
  behalf.

These changes aim to provide clearer and more consistent terminology, accounting
for the possibility of components having both service and frontend
functionalities. Additionally, the use of "client" for frontends will be
replaced to avoid potential confusion.

We recommend using the NATS client libraries recommended by NATS itself, unless
there are no suitable options available for the targeted language/environment.
We will not develop our own client libraries unless there is a lack of suitable
options or significant advantages justify the effort.

While Deno/TypeScript is the recommended choice for backend services, its use is
not mandatory. Developers will be encouraged to use Deno/TypeScript where
appropriate, but other options will still be supported for specific services.
Comprehensive documentation and resources will be provided for writing and
deploying Deno-based backend services in TypeScript.

Please consider these changes and updates as you continue with Telestion
development.
